action plan set out in be approved.report details in order to respond to climate issues that have been caused by an increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, eden district council is taking action to reduce our emissions and to find solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change.eden district council declared a climate and ecological emergency in july the objective is to make the council s operations zero carbon by to encourage initiatives which help eden district to become net zero carbon.to improve biodiversity while preserving our working cultural landscapes and economies.our wish is for eden to be a sustainable place where everyone has an opportunity to prosper.this strategy has been produced to show the actions that the council will take to achieve net zero carbon emissions across the council s activities, as well as working to influence the wider district to work towards the same objective by the zero carbon and biodiversity strategy is fundamental to the delivery of our council plan.this underpins the council s work by setting out its clear vision for the district and the priorities it will focus on in order to deliver that vision.this strategy will support the delivery of all corporate priorities with a particular focus on improving the council s carbon footprint and protecting eden s working cultural landscapes and biodiversity, aiming to store more carbon than is produced in the district.in addition to this and in conjunction with the housing strategy there will also be an emphasis on improving housing to be more energy efficient.the

term change in the average local, regional, weather patterns and global climate.the changes observed in the earth s climate since the early 20th century are primarily driven by human activity and particularly, by burning fossil fuels which increases the amount of heat trapping greenhouse gases in the earth s atmospherean increase in global temperature has contributed to more regular and intense extreme climatic events such as floods, droughts, storms and many more that are impacting human lives and ecosystems across the globe.figure shows that the average temperature of the united kingdom has been steadily increasing since the 2000s.since the warmest years in the united kingdom have been reported in the last years.figure warmer and cooler years in the uk since cumbria in cumbria the climate is influenced by the north atlantic drift which, along with the mountainous terrain makes it the wettest region of england.the average annual precipitation is about mm but this varies greatly depending of the locationover the past decade, cumbria has been affected by the effect of climate change through flooding events, including storm desmond in which caused much damage and disruption across the region.these storms are predicted to be more frequent due to the actual trends of climate change, which mean that cumbria will be more vulnerable to more frequent and intense floods and storm episodes.nasa.overview weather, global warming and climate change met office.what is climate change in the future, cumbria should expect more variance during the seasons with hotter and drier summers and wetter and milder winters.eden district similar to the general climate of cumbria, the eden district experiences the same maritime climatic influence, but due to its location, the district appears to be much dryer than the average of cumbria with only m per yearfigure shows the evolution of temperature and precipitation recorded by newton rigg s weather station.the average temperature has risen by around degree celsius since but of the average annual temperature reaching 9oc have been recorded after the precipitation overall has increased by m in years.figure annual temperature and precipitation variation since the climate across the eden district will be further affected by the rise in average temperature and precipitation leading to an increase in frequency and severity of extreme weather events .due to its geographical location, the landscape of the eden district is mainly composed by lowland making the area more subject to frequent and long periods of floodingaccording to the paris agreement, parties including the united kingdom have agreed to curb global warming to well below degrees celsius, preferably by degrees celsius, compared to pre industrial levels.to help tackle the effect of climate met office north west england and isle of man climate change, most levels of government must act urgently.nowadays, of local ities throughout the united kingdom have already declared a climate emergency.small scale actions are essential to tackle the climate and ecological emergenciesstrategic planning the following action plan fits with and alongside all other council plans and strategies and ultimately the sustainability objectives outlined in this document will need to be reflected in all future policies and provision of services.copthis year the un climate change conference is bringing together almost every nation in the uk to reach agreement on how to tackle climate change and how to implement the paris agreement made in the copwill be the moment for countries to update their plans for reducing carbon emissions and focus on more effective means to adapt to the impacts of climate change and climate resilient development to keep temperature rise to alive.the decade out to will be crucial and the cop needs to be decisive.more than world leaders, tens of thousands of negotiators, government representatives, businesses and citizens will meet in glasgow for twelve days to talk and explore solutions.the mains goals of the copare secure global net zero by mid century and keep degrees within reach adapt to protect communities and natural habitats mobilise finance work together to deliver eden district council s carbon reduction and biodiversity action plan has aligned its sustainability actions in relation to the above copgoals.united nation, paris agreement figure impact of climate change and uk action plan to be carbon neutral by eden district council s role in order to respond to climate issues that have been caused by an increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, eden district council is taking action to reduce our emissions and to find solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change.climatic and ecological emergency eden district council declared a climate and ecological emergency in july the objective is to make the council s operations zero carbon by to encourage initiatives which help eden district to become net zero carbon.to improve biodiversity while preserving our working cultural landscapes and economies.our wish is for eden to be a sustainable place where everyone has an opportunity to prosper.this strategy has been produced to show the actions that the council will take to achieve net zero carbon emissions across the council s activities, as well as working to influence the wider district to work towards the same objective by at eden district council we are responsible for our own emissions and aspire to set an example to other organisations and residents that net zero carbon is achievable.as a local ity we also have the ability to directly and indirectly influence the emissions of the district as a whole.the corporate plan the zero carbon and biodiversity strategy is fundamental to the delivery of our council plan.this underpins the council s work by setting out its clear vision for the district and the priorities it will focus on in order to deliver that vision.the council plan identifies its vision as for eden to become a place where the people act together to meet the needs of all and ensure the wellbeing of future generations. in order to achieve this goal there is a focus on four priorities eden district council s corporate priorities sustainable healthy, safe and connected creative co produce secure improve digital support businesses to economic improve housing, connectivity, transport respond to national opportunities and both new build and and access to attract and and global changes strategies that will existing, working support businesses, and encourage protect eden s towards self employees and families, innovation in tourism, working cultural sufficiency in energy connecting eden with the food and green landscapes and and co produce global economy and industries and develop biodiversity aiming healthy, connected, knowledge industries.arts and cultural to store more prosperous people are connected in activities to add to carbon than is communities for all, communities with access town centre vibrancy, produced in the urban and rural to education, work, support communities district healthcare and leisure and improve health and well being this strategy will support the delivery of all corporate priorities with a particular focus on improving the council s carbon footprint and protecting eden s working cultural landscapes and biodiversity, aiming to store more carbon than is produced in the district.in addition to this and in conjunction with the housing strategy there will also be an emphasis on improving housing to be more energy efficient.recovery plan the covid pandemic has highlighted the importance of the environment around us, bringing many of us closer to nature.the pandemic has also provided us with a unique opportunity for change as we have had to reconsider the way we live.it is essential that we continue to welcome change as we recover from the pandemic, to create a future that sees healthy populations living in harmony with a thriving natural environment.the strategic aim of our recovery plan is to build back better in a way that rebalances the relationship between the economy, communities and the environment to ensure repaid rebuilding where needed and sustainable growth and improvement into the future.our recovery plan contains many cross cutting interventions working within our key priorities.many of these interventions fall under sustainability, aiming to reduce carbon and support biodiversity while promoting our other priorities.this strategy builds on the recovery plan, developing sustainability initiatives and showing what can be done to reduce eden district council s carbon footprint, as well as the carbon footprint of the district.carbon footprint carbon footprint is defined by the total amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly to support a business or a person s lifestyle and activities.carbon footprints are usually measured in equivalent tonnes of carbon dioxide over a year and can be related to an individual, an entity, an event, a production chain, and many other activitiesto aid analysis and to understand the greenhouse gas emissions sources, the different gas emissions are generally broken down into major categories scope all direct emissions produced from or under the control of an organisation s operations.scope indirect emissions from electricity consumed by the organisation.scope all other indirect emissions from activities linked with the organisation that derive from sources that it doesn t own or control.sol a., miro l., f.cabeza l., high temperature thermal storage systems using phase change, chapter environmental approach.academic press.greenhouse gas protocol and carbon trust team, technical guidance for calculating scope emissions figure sources of greenhouse gas emissions categorised in their scopes. eden district council s carbon footprint the following carbon footprint data measures the greenhouses gas emissions that have been emitted under the council s direct and indirect control.this includes emissions from the council buildings, energy consumption, and fleet vehicles, use of personal vehicles for staff, as well as transmissions and distribution.during eden district council has released about tonnes carbon dioxide emissions.this is a decrease from a positive note that inspires us to work towards our ambition to be carbon free by figure shows the estimated carbon dioxide emissions emissions from eden district council for electric use represents of our total emissions, this includes electric use in our properties, but also from street lighting and other street scene functions.followed by staff business travel, at accounting for the journeys made by staff for work.therefore these are the main areas to focus our effort to internally to reduce our impact on the environment.heating and water related emissions have a much smaller impact of and respectively, however and whilst they are still important areas to manage when considering our targets.figure eden district council overall carbon dioxide emissions emissions eden district s carbon footprint the carbon footprint of each cumbrian local ity area has been individually estimated by small world consulting in their carbon baseline for cumbria report allowing us to observe the disparity in carbon footprint from one district to another.production based greenhouse gas emissions calculate emissions that are generated from the domestic production of goods and services regardless of whether they are consumed domestically or abroadas shown in figure eden district produces 703ktonnes carbon dioxide emissions per year.compared to all other districts, eden district register the highest carbon dioxide emissions in cumbria, followed closely by south lakeland with ktonnes carbon dioxide emissions.a part of the calculation has integrated our potential carbon dioxide emissions offsetting from land use, land use change and forestry , which has the potential to offset 30ktonnes carbon dioxide emissions.moss j., berners lee m., freitag c., and donaldson s., a carbon baseline for cumbria.small world consulting ltd karakaya e., ylmaz b., and alata s., how production based and consumption based emissions accounting systems change climate policy analysis the case of co convergence.mpra as previously stated, the carbon dioxide emissions emissions associated with industrial and commercial use and agriculture are the highest in eden compared to the other districts.however, emissions related to domestic energy are amongst the lowest in cumbria.figure emissions of carbon dioxide emissions according to each cumbrian districts production based emissions do not integrate the production of goods and services that are used in the district when they are produced somewhere else in the united kingdom or abroad.in order to provide a more reliable carbon footprint for the district, it is necessary to take into account the consumption based emissions as well.parish level to assess the carbon footprint of the different parishes that compose eden district, a carbon calculation tool has been created by centre of sustainable energy.this online tool will allow eden district council to observe carbon emissions emitted locally and to engage with parishes to find mitigation and adaption solutions that will help them reduce their carbon footprint.vision for low carbon cumbria.cumbria has used the services of small world consultancy to assess the carbon footprint of the county and cumbrian districts.in the report carbon baseline for cumbria, small world consulting provides a vision of what cumbria s activities could look like in zero carbon scenario.the targets and recommendations that follow are intended as part of wider roadmap to a better future for cumbria.we imagine them to be implemented in ways that maximise co benefits, especially in terms of health, community and economy.this overall vision for cumbria is broken down in the carbon baseline report from the perspective of residents, visitors and businesses.this is summarised as follows eden district s action plan according to the carbon baseline for cumbria, the county generated around mtonnes carbon dioxide in this includes emissions related to railways and carbon sequestration from land use but excluding all the emissions from the mmotorway.on average, a cumbrian resident emits tonnes carbon dioxide per year which is higher than the national average uk citizen .figure shows the improvement required in the tourism industries, consumption of goods and services and energy emissions to achieve the net zero by in cumbria.land use, land use change and forestry will play an important role in the absorption of greenhouse gases and in the reduction and negation of our carbon dioxide emissions emissions.figure actions needed to reach net zero emission by in order to achieve the objective to make eden district council and the wider district net zero carbon by there are significant changes and actions that need to take place across the district to tackle the effects of climate change.eden district council has started to implement several changes to reduce its carbon footprint what has the council done how have will the council achieve this improving the energy efficiency of eden improve the insulation of council owned district council owned buildings.buildings in order to reduce our energy usage.reduce emissions related to transport.introduce new transport solutions to reduce direct and indirect carbon emissions.introducing better waste management.reducing the amount of waste produced and improving recycling
