This report details the progress made both in terms of reducing our emissions and actions taken to develop projects designed to reduce emissions.  It should be noted that 2020 has proven to be a challenging year due to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Whilst the pandemic has led to some direct benefits including a direct reduction in overall emissions from some sources, it has also led to challenges in terms of reduced officer capacity to deliver projects.  Clear and meaningful progress has been made across a number of the ‘top 20 commitments for 2020’ with highlights including a switch to a 100% renewable electricity contract across the Council’s estate, an increase to the planned level of dimming across the Council’s street lighting assets and implementation of a Carbon Impact Assessment process across the Council’s operations. Of the many actions in the main part of this document, the following forms a summary of the top 21 commitments we aim to achieve over the next 12 months.  21 Commitments for 2021 Over the next 12 months, the Council will play its part to help mitigate and adapt to climate change with the following actions:      1. Develop and trial a proposal for minimum street lighting levels across the city to maximise carbon savings,         balancing environmental, social and economic factors.     2. Roll out ‘Carbon Literacy’ training during 2021, initially focusing on Members of the Climate Change Cross         Party Working Group, Change Champions and lead officers from each department across the Council.     3. Seek to secure funding from future rounds of the Public Sector Decarbonisation scheme (or an alternative         source) to improve the efficiency of the Council’s estate.     4. Develop a process for collecting additional emissions data from the Council’s farm estate and seek funding         to undertake research to identify potential opportunities to reduce carbon emissions from peat soils.     5. Develop a process for collecting additional emissions data from 3rd party organisations including         Medesham Homes and Opportunity Peterborough.     6. Develop a process for collecting additional emissions data from purchased materials and work with the         Council’s procurement team to identify mechanisms to improve the sustainability of the council’s         procurement process.     7. When normal Mayoral duties resume, a new lease for the Mayoral car will be considered which will include         options for an electric or hybrid vehicle.     8. To ascertain and review options to enable the Council to consider switching to a low carbon gas tariff.     9. Begin to implement recommendations from the fleet review undertaken by Aragon which will see the         introduction of new electric vehicles.     10. Develop detailed carbon assessments for two major highway projects and use the information to influence         the final design.     11. Engage with national government on the resources and legislation necessary to empower local         government to deliver our climate ambitions.     12. Develop a Business Case to establish the viability of switching the local Skanska fleet to an alternative         sustainable fuel.     13. Investigate the opportunities to reduce emissions from the Regional Swimming Pool, currently the         Council’s single highest carbon emitting site.     14. Continue to rationalise office floorspace thereby reducing energy demands, for example, excess floorspace         at the Town Hall will be leased.                                                             2 _x000C_                                                                                               Council-CMAP-2021 15. Initiate a process to identify adaptation opportunities across the Council’s operations and potential     interventions. 16. Roll out further guidance and training for staff in relation to the recently introduced ‘Carbon Impact     Assessment’ procedure – a new assessment which requires all Council decisions to be assessed for the     carbon implications of the decision being made. 17. Actively participate in a citywide Climate Change Partnership forum, and the annual Climate Change     Action day. 18. Further develop the cross-party Climate Change Member Working Group, so that each political party of     the Council can both champion carbon savings, scrutinise decision making and steer further carbon savings     initiatives and ideas. 19. Work with other local authorities to ensure best practice is shared and opportunities to collaborate are     identified and developed. 20. Hold the second annual Climate Action Day, known as March Forth to engage businesses and residents     across the city. This day will be a celebration of the work to date, as well an opportunity to share ideas on     how to tackle climate change and take a pledge to adopt climate friendly behaviours for the day. 21. Conduct a staff travel survey once Covid-19 restrictions are lifted to understand the change in travel     behaviour. Opportunities to support home working where feasible will be explored.                                                          3 _x000C_                                                                                                       Council-CMAP-2021  1 Introduction Peterborough has the potential to be a truly sustainable city. A city which has a thriving local economy, strong communities and a sustainable way of life. A city where our residents are healthy, happy and prosperous.  To achieve this we will need to do things differently. If everyone on Earth lived as the average Peterborian, British or European citizen does, we would need nearly three planets’ worth of resources to sustain us1. This means, on average, each of us is using too much of the world’s resources to produce the food we eat, treat the waste we produce, generate the energy we use, consume the goods and services we take for granted, and the travel around the area and beyond.  Peterborough City Council has committed to take action to reverse the trend of increasing consumption of natural resources, and instead put Peterborough on the road to becoming a truly sustainable city. It remains clear that there is an unprecedented urgency to address climate change. The climate science is unequivocal. There is recognition that the impacts of climate breakdown are already causing serious damage around the world. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, describes the enormous harm that a 2°C average rise in global temperatures is likely to cause compared with a 1.5°C rise (IPCC, 2018). And we can see the local evidence of rising temperatures ourselves. In July 2019, Cambridgeshire was the hottest place in the UK reaching an all-time high temperature of 38.1°C2. The latest UK climate projections (UKCP18) suggest that the UK climate will continue to warm over the rest of this century, and on average, will result in hotter and drier summers, warmer and wetter winters with more extreme weather events expected, though individual years may not conform to this pattern (Environment Agency, 2018).  In response Peterborough City Council declared a ‘climate emergency’ on 24th July 2019 (Peterborough City Council, 2019a). In doing so the Council joined a global movement which worldwide has seen, to date, 1,863 jurisdictions in 33 countries declare a climate emergency, and within this 400 local authorities in the UK3.  In making this declaration the Council committed to a wide range of comprehensive actions, including, in summary:      \\uf0b7   Make the Council\\'s activities and the city\\'s net-zero carbon by 2030 with a baseline, action plan and budget         by 31st March 2020.     \\uf0b7   Ensure political and chief officer leadership to embed this priority into work, ensuring all decisions are in         line with net-zero carbon by 2030.     \\uf0b7   Set up a Climate Change Partnership group proactively involving young people and convene a citizen\\'s         assembly.     \\uf0b7   Review 2020/21 budget proposals and ascertain environmental impact.     \\uf0b7   Use planning powers to deliver net carbon new developments and communities and increase tree planting.     \\uf0b7   Achieve 100% clean energy across the Council’s full range of functions by 2030 and explore renewable         generation and storage.     \\uf0b7   Replace all Council vehicles with electric or hybrids including the mayor’s car, provide electric vehicle         infrastructure and encourage alternatives to private car use across the city.     \\uf0b7   Increase the efficiency of buildings, in particular to address fuel poverty.     \\uf0b7   Coordinate events to raise awareness and share best practice and keep everyone updated.   1   WWF states that if everybody in the world lived as the average EU resident, we would have exhausted nature’s budget for 2019 by 10 May 2019, and would need 2.8 planets to sustain us. (WWF, 2019) 2   “The UK has seen its hottest July day ever as the temperature reached 38.1C in Cambridge. The new record outstripped the previous high for the month of 36.7C, set at Heathrow in July 2015.” (New Scientist, 2019) 3   Figures correct as of December 2019 (The Climate Emergency Declarations and Mobilisation, 2019)                                                              4 _x000C_                                                                                               Council-CMAP-2021     \\uf0b7    Call on the UK Government to provide the powers, resources and help with funding to make this possible          and ask local MPs to do likewise.  Many of the above actions are directly or indirectly related to reducing our carbon emissions, with the headline being to hit the net zero target by 2030 for the Council’s activities.  This document:      \\uf0b7    Sets out what our current carbon emissions are so we know what progress we have made and can continue          to set meaningful targets and milestones.     \\uf0b7    Details the progress made on projects we have undertaken to date and sets out projects we intend to          deliver (or continue to deliver) to reduce our emissions.     \\uf0b7    Puts forward potential future projects and ideas requiring further investigation.     \\uf0b7    Discusses funding options.     \\uf0b7    Discusses how this process will be managed.

This is sometimes known as working out our ‘carbon footprint’ which is a measure of the greenhouse gases (GHGs)4 emitted into the atmosphere from sources in a specified area or organisation. It usually includes all relevant greenhouse gases, the most common of which is carbon dioxide (CO2). Emissions of other GHGs such as methane (CH4) or nitrous oxide (N2O), are measured in ‘carbon dioxide equivalent’ (CO2e)5.  Nationwide, emissions of CO2 make up 81% of GHG emissions, with the remainder from methane (11%), nitrous oxide (4%) and fluorinated gases (3%), when weighted by Global Warming Potential (GWP)6. The biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK is transport, closely followed by stationary energy (emissions arising from buildings).  This Action Plan examines the carbon footprint of Peterborough City Council as an organisation. The carbon footprint of the geographical area of Peterborough as a whole is examined thoroughly in a separate draft Citywide Carbon Management Action Plan.  The methodology for the calculation of the Council’s carbon footprint can be found in appendix B.  2.1 Carbon Footprint Results 2019-20 The carbon footprint of Peterborough City Council (as an organisation) comprises emissions that occur as a result of the Council’s own operations.  We have calculated the carbon footprint of the Council’s own operations in line with the UK Government’s Environmental Reporting Guidelines for Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Reporting7.  Scope 1 (direct) and scope 2 (purchased electricity) emissions amounted to 5,758 tonnes CO2e. Scope 1 and 2 includes emissions from gas and oil for heating our buildings, electricity for our buildings and street lighting etc. and emissions from fleet vehicles. Scope 1 and 2 are generally considered to be areas that are within an organisation’s control and therefore the organisation can reduce the resultant emissions. Scope 3 emissions amounted to 3,855 tonnes CO2e. Scope 3 are considered to be indirect emissions that an organisation cannot directly control and therefore the ability to reduce emissions to net-zero is more difficult.     4   The main GHGs are: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and Nitrogen Trifluoride (NF3). The Kyoto Protocol – the international agreement addressing climate change - covers these seven main GHGs. The last four are fluorinated gases (\"F-gases\") which are a range of man-made compounds (including HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and NF3) used in a variety of industries including refrigeration, air-conditioning and the manufacture of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, electronics and aluminium. F-gases are extremely potent greenhouse gases with some having GWPs of several thousand or more (BEIS, 2020a). The greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol account for over 99% of global greenhouse gas emissions. 5   By using CO2e as a measuring tool means that the different global warming potential (GWP) of different gases are taken into account. Quantities of GHGs are multiplied by their GWP to give results in units of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) 6   Global warming potential. A factor describing the radiative force impact (degree of harm to the atmosphere) of one unit of a given GHG relative to one unit of CO2. 7   These reporting guidelines are based on internationally-recognised standards from the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development: the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, and the GHG Protocol Scope 3 standard. (BEIS, 2020a)                                                                6 _x000C_                                                                                                Council-CMAP-2021 2.1.1 Results summary Emissions have been calculated using data for the financial year 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020. The resultant emissions for 2019-20 total 9,613 tonnes of CO2e. The baseline was originally calculated for the financial year 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 and the most recent emission calculations are shown below to allow comparison.  This is summarised as follows:   Total Gross Emissions                                              Baseline Emissions      Current Emissions                                                                          2018-19                 2019-20  for Scope 1 (direct - largely gas and council owned transport)                    2,721                   2,255   for Scope 2 (indirect - largely electricity)                                      4,924                   3,503   for Scope 3 (other indirect)                                                      3,962                   3,855           Total                                                                   11,607                    9,613 Table 1: Summary GHG emissions (CO2e, tonnes)     Figure 2: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by scope, 2019-20 There has been a clear reduction in overall emissions from the baseline year. This has been in part due to decarbonisation of the national electricity grid, as the energy mix provided by the grid comes from a greater                                                             7 _x000C_                                                                                                           Council-CMAP-2021 proportion of sustainable sources (wind, solar etc.). As a result carbon emissions associated with electricity generation reduced by almost 10% compared to the previous year (BEIS, 2020c).  2.1.2 Results by Business Area Buildings and utilities account for 6,904 tonnes CO2e, which is 72% of all current known emissions. The largest source of gross emissions within buildings and utilities is electricity usage, accounting for 1,167 tonnes CO2e plus another 99 tonnes for transmission and distribution losses (scope 3).

The largest single contributing service area is cultural services which emitted approximately 2,525 tonnes of CO2e, closely followed by street lighting at 1,925 tonnes of CO2e. The largest single contributing building is the Regional Pool which emitted approximately 681 tonnes of CO2e, closely followed by Sand Martin House at 443 tonnes of CO2e.     8   Transmission & Distribution (T&D) emissions relate to emissions associated with grid losses (the energy loss that occurs in getting the electricity from the power plant to the organisations that purchase it) 9   Well To Tank (WTT) emissions relate to emissions caused by the extraction, refinement and transportation of primary fuels                                                                8 _x000C_                                                                                                    Council-CMAP-2021     Figure 3: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by business area, 2019-20     Figure 4: Breakdown of emissions by scope and type, tonnes of CO2e   2.1.3 Intensity Ratios Local government responsibilities are often flexible with activities differing over time. As these changing activities will affect the amount of carbon emitted, it is sometimes advantageous to express emissions as intensity ratios. Intensity ratios express the GHG impact per unit of economic value or per member of staff. The Council employed 954 FTE in 2019-20 which equates to an intensity measure of 6.04 tCO2e/FTE (full time equivalent) (scope 1 and 2                                                            9 _x000C_                                                                                                Council-CMAP-2021 only). The Council turned over £505,766,000 in 2019-20, which equates to an intensity measure of 19.18 tCO2e/£1m.                                         2018-19                               2019-20  Intensity ratio: staff                8.01 tCO2e/FTE                        6.04 tCO2e/FTE  Intensity ratio: turnover             19.18 tCO2e/£1m                       19.01 tCO2e/£1m   It should be noted that the Council delivers some of its services via 3rd party arrangements and the FTE for these services is not included e.g. Aragon. The Council is also delivering a number of services via partnership arrangements with Cambridgeshire County Council; this is reflected in the overall FTE count.                                                            10 _x000C_                                                                                                     Council-CMAP-2021  3 Decarbonisation Projects The commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across both the city of Peterborough and the Council’s operations is a crucial yet momentous task. There is an indefinite list of changes required, many of which are only realistically feasible on a regional or national scale; however there are some practical actions that can be taken at a local level. The following section of this report provides a breakdown of projects that the Council will seek to take forward. In order to make decisions on what projects to take forward, the Council will assess projects based on the following criteria:      \\uf0b7   Cost of the action proposed in relation to the CO2e saved (i.e. CO2e saving per £ spent)     \\uf0b7   Ease of implementation (i.e. the actions that will make savings sooner)     \\uf0b7   Public demonstration (the Council has an important role in demonstrating how projects which tackle         climate change can be completed to other organisations and businesses)  3.1 Peterborough City Council’s Projects The Council has completed several projects in recent years that will have reduced carbon emissions. This is good news and demonstrates the long term commitment this Council has to minimise its impact on the environment. However, being a leading Council over the years actually makes the task to reduce of emissions further and quickly harder with many of the ‘easy’ wins having already been taken.  3.1.1 Committed Projects - update The Council has already committed to undertaking a number of projects that aim to directly reduce carbon emissions. An update detailing the progress made on these projects is set out below:                    Business     Project                              Project Details                                  Update                     Area  Street Light    Street        Following the LED street lighting     The proposal detailed here commenced in  Dimming         Lighting      upgrade programme the Council is      April 2020. However this was surpassed in                                now able to dim street lights. As     response to the Covid-19 emergency which                                part of phase one of the 2020/21      resulted in street lighting levels across the                                budget setting process a trial was    city being reduced by 40% during the hours of                                proposed to dim lights in residential darkness.

executive summary in march 2020 we adopted a new council carbon management action plan setting out how we intend to cut our organisational carbon emissions. this report details the progress made both in terms of reducing our emissions and actions taken to develop projects designed to reduce emissions. it should be noted that 2020 has proven to be a challenging year due to the impacts of the covid 19 pandemic. whilst the pandemic has led to some direct benefits including a direct reduction in overall emissions from some sources, it has also led to challenges in terms of reduced officer capacity to deliver projects. clear and meaningful progress has been made across a number of the top 20 commitments for 2020 with highlights including a switch to a 100 per cent renewable electricity contract across the councils estate, an increase to the planned level of dimming across the councils street lighting assets and implementation of a carbon impact assessment process across the councils operations. of the many actions in the main part of this document, the following forms a summary of the top 21 commitments we aim to achieve over the next 12 months. 21 commitments for 2021 over the next 12 months, the council will play its part to help mitigate and adapt to climate change with the following actions 1. develop and trial a proposal for minimum street lighting levels across the city to maximise carbon savings, balancing environmental, social and economic factors. 2. roll out carbon literacy training during 2021, initially focusing on members of the climate change cross party working group, change champions and lead officers from each department across the council. 3. seek to secure funding from future rounds of the public sector decarbonisation scheme to improve the efficiency of the councils estate. 4. develop a process for collecting additional emissions data from the councils farm estate and seek funding to undertake research to identify potential opportunities to reduce carbon emissions from peat soils. 5. develop a process for collecting additional emissions data from 3rd party organisations including medesham homes and opportunity peterborough. 6. develop a process for collecting additional emissions data from purchased materials and work with the councils procurement team to identify mechanisms to improve the sustainability of the councils procurement process. 7. when normal mayoral duties resume, a new lease for the mayoral car will be considered which will include options for an electric or hybrid vehicle. 8. to ascertain and review options to enable the council to consider switching to a low carbon gas tariff. 9. begin to implement recommendations from the fleet review undertaken by aragon which will see the introduction of new electric vehicles. 10. develop detailed carbon assessments for two major highway projects and use the information to influence the final design. 11. engage with national government on the resources and legislation necessary to empower local government to deliver our climate ambitions. 12. develop a business case to establish the viability of switching the local skanska fleet to an alternative sustainable fuel. 13. investigate the opportunities to reduce emissions from the regional swimming pool, currently the councils single highest carbon emitting site. 14. continue to rationalise office floorspace thereby reducing energy demands, for example, excess floorspace at the town hall will be leased. 2 council cmap 2021 15. initiate a process to identify adaptation opportunities across the councils operations and potential interventions. 16. roll out further guidance and training for staff in relation to the recently introduced carbon impact assessment procedure  a new assessment which requires all council decisions to be assessed for the carbon implications of the decision being made. 17. actively participate in a citywide climate change partnership forum, and the annual climate change action day. 18. further develop the cross party climate change member working group, so that each political party of the council can both champion carbon savings, scrutinise decision making and steer further carbon savings initiatives and ideas. 19. work with other local authorities to ensure best practice is shared and opportunities to collaborate are identified and developed. 20. hold the second annual climate action day, known as march forth to engage businesses and residents across the city. this day will be a celebration of the work to date, as well an opportunity to share ideas on how to tackle climate change and take a pledge to adopt climate friendly behaviours for the day. 21. conduct a staff travel survey once covid 19 restrictions are lifted to understand the change in travel behaviour. opportunities to support home working where feasible will be explored. 3 council cmap 2021 1 introduction peterborough has the potential to be a truly sustainable city. a city which has a thriving local economy, strong communities and a sustainable way of life. a city where our residents are healthy, happy and prosperous. to achieve this we will need to do things differently. if everyone on earth lived as the average peterborian, british or european citizen does, we would need nearly three planets worth of resources to sustain us1. this means, on average, each of us is using too much of the worlds resources to produce the food we eat, treat the waste we produce, generate the energy we use, consume the goods and services we take for granted, and the travel around the area and beyond. peterborough city council has committed to take action to reverse the trend of increasing consumption of natural resources, and instead put peterborough on the road to becoming a truly sustainable city. it remains clear that there is an unprecedented urgency to address climate change. the climate science is unequivocal. there is recognition that the impacts of climate breakdown are already causing serious damage around the world. the intergovernmental panel on climate change special report on global warming of 1.5 degrees celcius, describes the enormous harm that a 2 degrees celcius average rise in global temperatures is likely to cause compared with a 1.5 degrees celcius rise . and we can see the local evidence of rising temperatures ourselves. in july 2019, cambridgeshire was the hottest place in the uk reaching an all time high temperature of 38.1 degrees celcius2. the latest uk climate projections suggest that the uk climate will continue to warm over the rest of this century, and on average, will result in hotter and drier summers, warmer and wetter winters with more extreme weather events expected, though individual years may not conform to this pattern . in response peterborough city council declared a climate emergency on 24th july 2019 . in doing so the council joined a global movement which worldwide has seen, to date, 1,863 jurisdictions in 33 countries declare a climate emergency, and within this 400 local authorities in the uk3. in making this declaration the council committed to a wide range of comprehensive actions, including, in summary make the councils activities and the citys net zero carbon by 2030 with a baseline, action plan and budget by 31st march 2020. ensure political and chief officer leadership to embed this priority into work, ensuring all decisions are in line with net zero carbon by 2030. set up a climate change partnership group proactively involving young people and convene a citizens assembly. review 2020 21 budget proposals and ascertain environmental impact. use planning powers to deliver net carbon new developments and communities and increase tree planting. achieve 100 per cent clean energy across the councils full range of functions by 2030 and explore renewable generation and storage. replace all council vehicles with electric or hybrids including the mayors car, provide electric vehicle infrastructure and encourage alternatives to private car use across the city. increase the efficiency of buildings, in particular to address fuel poverty. coordinate events to raise awareness and share best practice and keep everyone updated. 1 wwf states that if everybody in the world lived as the average eu resident, we would have exhausted natures budget for 2019 by 10 may 2019, and would need 2.8 planets to sustain us. 2 the uk has seen its hottest july day ever as the temperature reached 38.1c in cambridge. the new record outstripped the previous high for the month of 36.7c, set at heathrow in july 2015. 3 figures correct as of december 2019 4 council cmap 2021 call on the uk government to provide the powers, resources and help with funding to make this possible and ask local mps to do likewise. many of the above actions are directly or indirectly related to reducing our carbon emissions, with the headline

5 council cmap 2021 2 our carbon footprint in order to decide what should be done to reduce our emissions, we need to properly understand what our current activities are emitting. this is sometimes known as working out our carbon footprint which is a measure of the greenhouse gases 4 emitted into the atmosphere from sources in a specified area or organisation. it usually includes all relevant greenhouse gases, the most common of which is carbon dioxide . emissions of other greenhouse gass such as methane or nitrous oxide , are measured in carbon dioxide equivalent 5. nationwide, emissions of carbon dioxide make up 81 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, with the remainder from methane , nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases , when weighted by global warming potential 6. the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the uk is transport, closely followed by stationary energy . this action plan examines the carbon footprint of peterborough city council as an organisation. the carbon footprint of the geographical area of peterborough as a whole is examined thoroughly in a separate draft citywide carbon management action plan. the methodology for the calculation of the councils carbon footprint can be found in appendix b. 2.1 carbon footprint results 2019 20 the carbon footprint of peterborough city council comprises emissions that occur as a result of the councils own operations. we have calculated the carbon footprint of the councils own operations in line with the uk governments environmental reporting guidelines for voluntary greenhouse gas reporting7. scope 1 and scope 2 emissions amounted to 5,758 tonnes carbon dioxide emissions. scope 1 and 2 includes emissions from gas and oil for heating our buildings, electricity for our buildings and street lighting etc. and emissions from fleet vehicles. scope 1 and 2 are generally considered to be areas that are within an organisations control and therefore the organisation can reduce the resultant emissions. scope 3 emissions amounted to 3,855 tonnes carbon dioxide emissions. scope 3 are considered to be indirect emissions that an organisation cannot directly control and therefore the ability to reduce emissions to net zero is more difficult. 4 the main greenhouse gass are carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxide , hydrofluorocarbons , perfluorocarbons , sulphur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride . the kyoto protocol  the international agreement addressing climate change covers these seven main greenhouse gass. the last four are fluorinated gases which are a range of man made compounds used in a variety of industries including refrigeration, air conditioning and the manufacture of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, electronics and aluminium. f gases are extremely potent greenhouse gases with some having gwps of several thousand or more . the greenhouse gases covered by the kyoto protocol account for over 99 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. 5 by using carbon dioxide emissions as a measuring tool means that the different global warming potential of different gases are taken into account. quantities of greenhouse gass are multiplied by their gwp to give results in units of carbon dioxide equivalent 6 global warming potential. a factor describing the radiative force impact of one unit of a given greenhouse gas relative to one unit of carbon dioxide. 7 these reporting guidelines are based on internationally recognised standards from the world resources institute and world business council for sustainable development the greenhouse gas protocol corporate accounting and reporting standard, and the greenhouse gas protocol scope 3 standard. 6 council cmap 2021 2.1.1 results summary emissions have been calculated using data for the financial year 1 april 2019 to 31 march 2020. the resultant emissions for 2019 20 total 9,613 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. the baseline was originally calculated for the financial year 1 april 2018 to 31 march 2019 and the most recent emission calculations are shown below to allow comparison. this is summarised as follows total gross emissions baseline emissions current emissions 2018 19 2019 20 for scope 1 2,721 2,255 for scope 2 4,924 3,503 for scope 3 3,962 3,855 total 11,607 9,613 table 1 summary greenhouse gas emissions figure 2 greenhouse gas emissions by scope, 2019 20 there has been a clear reduction in overall emissions from the baseline year. this has been in part due to decarbonisation of the national electricity grid, as the energy mix provided by the grid comes from a greater 7 council cmap 2021 proportion of sustainable sources . as a result carbon emissions associated with electricity generation reduced by almost 10 per cent compared to the previous year . 2.1.2 results by business area buildings and utilities account for 6,904 tonnes carbon dioxide emissions, which is 72 per cent of all current known emissions. the largest source of gross emissions within buildings and utilities is electricity usage, accounting for 1,167 tonnes carbon dioxide emissions plus another 99 tonnes for transmission and distribution losses . greenhouse gas emissions

prioritise those service areas for decarbonisation projects. the largest single contributing service area is cultural services which emitted approximately 2,525 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, closely followed by street lighting at 1,925 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. the largest single contributing building is the regional pool which emitted approximately 681 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, closely followed by sand martin house at 443 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. 8 transmission and distribution emissions relate to emissions associated with grid losses 9 well to tank emissions relate to emissions caused by the extraction, refinement and transportation of primary fuels 8 council cmap 2021 figure 3 greenhouse gas emissions by business area, 2019 20 figure 4 breakdown of emissions by scope and type, tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions 2.1.3 intensity ratios local government responsibilities are often flexible with activities differing over time. as these changing activities will affect the amount of carbon emitted, it is sometimes advantageous to express emissions as intensity ratios. intensity ratios express the greenhouse gas impact per unit of economic value or per member of staff. the council employed 954 fte in 2019 20 which equates to an intensity measure of 6.04 tonnes carbon dioxide emissions fte . the council turned over 505,766,000 in 2019 20, which equates to an intensity measure of 19.18 tonnes carbon dioxide emissions 1m. 2018 19 2019 20 intensity ratio staff 8.01 tonnes carbon dioxide emissions fte 6.04 tonnes carbon dioxide emissions fte intensity ratio turnover 19.18 tonnes carbon dioxide emissions 1m 19.01 tonnes carbon dioxide emissions 1m it should be noted that the council delivers some of its services via 3rd party arrangements and the fte for these services is not included e.g. aragon. the council is also delivering a number of services via partnership arrangements with cambridgeshire county council this is reflected in the overall fte count. 10 council cmap 2021 3 decarbonisation projects the commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions across both the city of peterborough and the councils operations is a crucial yet momentous task. there is an indefinite list of changes required, many of which are only realistically feasible on a regional or national scale however there are some practical actions that can be taken at a local level. the following section of this report provides a breakdown of projects that the council will seek to take forward. in order to make decisions on what projects to take forward, the council will assess projects based on the following criteria cost of the action proposed in relation to the carbon dioxide emissions saved ease of implementation public demonstration 3.1 peterborough city councils projects the council has completed several projects in recent years that will have reduced carbon emissions. this is good news and demonstrates the long term commitment this council has to minimise its impact on the environment. however, being a leading council over the years actually makes the task to reduce of emissions further and quickly harder with many of the easy wins having already been taken. 3.1.1 committed projects update the council has already committed to undertaking a number of projects that aim to directly reduce carbon emissions. an update detailing the progress made on these projects is set out below business project project details update area street light street following the led street lighting the proposal detailed here commenced in dimming lighting upgrade programme the council is april 2020. however this was surpassed in now able to dim street lights. as response to the covid 19 emergency which part of phase one of the 2020 21 resulted in street lighting levels across the budget setting process a trial was city being reduced by 40 per cent during the hours of proposed to dim lights in residential darkness. the carbon dioxide and financial saving was areas by 20 per cent between initially estimated over a period during the 9.30pm and 5am and on traffic summer months but due to the ongoing routes by 20 per cent between 9pm impact of the pandemic the actual savings will and midnight, and by 40 per cent significantly outweigh those predicted. the between midnight and 5am. data for this will be captured when emissions for the 2020 21 year are published in the next in order to calculate the reduction iteration of this plan. in carbon emissions arising, officers have undertaken an assessment to proposals to establish minimum lighting quantify the change in energy levels are currently being developed which it demand and have converted this to is hoped will allow some of these benefits to carbon dioxide emissions which results in an estimated be sustained. reduction of 183.7 tonnes carbon dioxide emissions, which accounts for more than a 1.5 per cent reduction of the total baseline 18 19 carbon

transport representing all of the councils officers, understandably, focussed on various service areas. these communicating other key messages. individuals are responsible for raising awareness of key initiatives however, the council has invested in carbon and embedding change across the literacy training for a member of the climate organisation. a key focus for the change team. this is a train the trainer style champions moving forward will be course which will allow a programme of to develop and deliver a training to be rolled out across the council programme of behavioural change during 2021. this will initially focus on activities to result in actions that members of the climate change cross party will directly reduce carbon working group, change champions and emissions across the councils colleagues from departments across the estate. this programme of work council i.e. finance, hr etc. commenced in december 2019 and a small budget has been allocated from the cu'"
