Forew ord 
Julie Butler  - Portfolio  Holder  
I am pleased  to introduce the Climate and Environment Strategy 2020 -2025 which will drive 
change . The climate crisis and the negative impact on our environment affects every 
resident in East Hampshire and beyond. It is the most important challenge we face, and we 
must  work together to tackle it.   
We declared a Climate and Environment Emergency on 19  July 2019.  Our work  so far  has 
considered options and consulted stakeholders  and shaped this strategy . I chair two Cabinet 
Liaison Panels, made up elected members from acr oss the political parties.  They  will work 
to inspire  change, lobby for funding and be the voices in their local communities.   
This spring, 2020, the unforeseen impact of a pandemic has  radically change d the way we  
behave and  work , demonstrating how adaptable we can be. We want use lessons learned 
from the response to Covid-19 to take action for the climate emergency.   
A changing climate has profound implications for the lives of everyone today,  and for future 
generations  as well . It directly influences how your Council  plans to meet the needs of 
everyone in the district.   But it is also everyone’s responsibility to make changes to address 
the crisis. We want to take an inclusive approach and maintain a dialogue on climate issues 
though our Let’s Talk initiative.  
There will be benefits if we get this right: energy -efficient buildings, affordable renewable 
energy , sustainable transport, food security, improved local biodiversity, and opportunities to 
strengthen enterprises of all types  in the trans ition to a low -carbon economy .  
This Strategy sets out East Hampshire District Council ’s vision for the Climate and 
Environment. We lead by tackling our operational direct and indirect emissions. We will work 
in partnership with the South Downs National Pa rk for sustainable development through 
Planning policy.  And we will take action to support our  residents,  communit ies, and 
businesses to deliver a low -carbon economically vibrant future for East Hampshire.  
I am determined this strategy will enable everyon e to pay their part in addressing the climate 
and environment emergency and look forward to working in partnership for a better future.

The changing climate is already having impacts  across the world and in the UK, including 
East Hampshire. Terrible images of flooding, severe weather events, storms and heatwaves 
and the devastating effects they have are seen with increasing frequency.  
In July 2019, East Hampshire District Council declared a Climate Emergency. The Council 
resolved to take action to make all Council Services carbon neutral as soon as reasonably 
practicable or in any case by 2050 in line with national targets. We committed to work with 
our partners and communities to make East Hampshire a carbon neutral district.  
Every time we decide to use our cars, fly away on holiday, buy goods,  and even switch on a 
light we are likely contributing to more greenhouse gas emissions.   
Reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions and achieving a decarbonised and secure 
energy supply is extremely challenging  because we will have to change the way we do 
everyday things .  
 The Council has declared a Climate Emergency and is committed to change  the way it 
delivers it services. This Strategy also lays out how the Council will su pport and influence 
our local communities and enterprises, so that everyone can make the changes we need to 
see. 
This strategy recognises that to achieve carbon neutrality  for council services, and  across 
the whole district , is a marathon, not a sprint.  This strategy commits  us to embed  protecting  
the climate in to our policies and decision making, but also to be accountable and maintain 
honest and robust reporting of our p rogress.  
As East Hampshire’s District Council’s Climate Champion, I have pledged to build networks 
and foster relationships we need to inspire and deliver positive change.  
Laying the policy foundation is just as important as winning hearts and minds. I h ave 
pledged to make our approach inclusive and wide -ranging. The prize is a sustainable and 
durable future, and I hope you can join us in making this a realisable outcome.

There is a global clim ate and environment  emergency. The evidence is irrefutable, and the 
science is clear. Human  beings are causing  damage  to the planet , and  that damage has 
accelerated over the past 50 years.  The impacts of the climate c risis are having serious 
negative impacts  on our livelihoods and communities.   
East Hampshire District Council declared a climate Emergency  in 2019 : it is not too late for  
us to turn things around , but success depends on everyone  to make  transformative change 
and act now.  
This strategy ha s been shaped  by stakeholder engagement  and by our elected members. An 
event held in February 2020 brought key stakeholders from across the district together for a 
day to consider and debate how the council can have the greatest impact in tacking the 
clima te crisis, and in protecting our local environment.  The strategy embraces how the 
Council can work with residents, communities and with all sectors of the local economy.  
The purpose of this strategy is to provide a clear statement of the Council’s climate and 
environment objectives and to set out how the Council  will act to meet  climate,  environment,  
and sustainability challenges.  
The Climate and Environment Strategy sets out the Council’s vision, approach, and priorities 
over the next five years. A supporting Action Plan  to be developed will  identif y initiatives and 
indicate how we will report on progress towards our goals.  
There are  two high level objectives  for the strategy : to reduce carbon emissions to net-zero 
by 2050; and to protect and enhanc e the local natural environment.  
We have outlined in the strategy how to reduce the Council’s emissions to net-zero, and how 
we will u se our influence and powers as local planning authority to promote a sustainable 
low-carbon future where people and nature  thrive.  
We will strengthen our working relationships with the South Downs , the County,  and our 
parishes to align policy and focus resources on tacking the climate crisis.  
East Hampshire District Council  will take an  inclusive approach and promote  ways fo r 
everyone to play a part  in tackling the climate emergency.   
Endorsement from the Chief Executive  
The Leadership  of East Hampshire District Council  recognise s the  climate crisis poses a  key 
risk for the authority. The first step was taken in July 2019 wh en Council unanimously moved 
to declare a Climate Emergenc y.  
The Climate and Environment Strategy 2020 -2025 builds on the declaration and pledges 
action to address the climate emergency. It firmly establishes a collaborative and integrated 
approach that e mbraces all our activities, including the Council’s own service delivery, and 
that of our contractors and partners. It highlights our mandate as a planning authority to 
ensure carbon net -zero is achieved by or before 2050 as we emerge from the 2020 Covid 1 9 
pandemic.  
 East Hampshire District Council  
Climate and Environment Strategy  2020 -2025   Page 4 of 16  Alongside net -zero, the strategy pledges to protect and enhance the natural environment. 
East Hampshire is a predominantly rural district, and our residents, businesses and visitors 
benefit from our wonderful landscape.  
The strategy provides the organisation with a clear roadmap for action and  gives me and my 
leadership team the go ahead to embed and mainstream climate in our business plans and 
to make the changes we need. The challenge is to reduce carbon in delivering our services, 
but also embed low -carbon outcomes for a vibrant economy and thriving community.  
One of our strengths is working in partnership, which we will use to inspire low -carbon 
outcomes across East Hampshire in collaboration with the South Downs National Park 
Authority, t he County Council, and our Town and Parish Councils.  
The next five years is a crucial period to set the course for net -zero, engage with all our 
stakeholders and embed the vision for the future.

1. Introduction  
Overview  
Climate change is a large -scale, long -term shift in the earth’s weather patterns as a result of 
increasing average  global  temperat ures. In recent decades  extreme  and unpredictable  
weather events  such as flash floods, storms and high winds, heatwaves, and summer 
droughts have caused a climate crisis .  
Human activity is responsible for the climate crisis. Burning fossil fuels, intensified 
agriculture, polluting industrial processes and the clearance of vegetation accelerate the 
impact of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  
The impact is recognised globa lly.  
National  and International Policy context  
The Inte rgovernmental  Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a report in October 2018 
which concluded that we have less than 12 years to act to avoid the worst impacts of climate 
change.   The report highlig hts a number of climate impacts that could be avoided by limiting 
global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C, or more.   It suggests that limiting global warming 
to 1.5°C may still be possible with ambitious action by governments that signed the Paris 
Agreemen t. 
The UK is one of over 150 nations to sign up to the UN Paris Agreement  in November 2016. 
By signing, all the countries committed to put forward their best efforts and to strengthen 
these efforts in the years ahead. This includes requirements that all countries  report 
regularly on their emissions and on their implementation efforts.  
On 12th June 2019, the UK government amended the Climate Change Act 2008, introducing 
a net -zero greenhouse gases target by 2050.   This commits the UK to eliminating emissio ns 
from homes , transport, farming and industry, or in the most difficult cases through offsetting 
by planting trees and carbon capture and storage.  
To achieve the  2050  net-zero target, the UK Government has adopted policies which 
envisage the role of local  authorities as a catalyst in delivering urgent and necessary action 
to address the climate crisis.  
In October 2017, the government adopted the Clean Growth Strategy, proposing measures 
for decarbonising all sectors of the UK economy through the 2020s. It explains how the 
whole country can benefit from low-carbon  opportunities, while meeting national and 
international commitments to tackle climate change. Amendments to this strategy have 
brought forward timescales for instance, banning the sale of petrol an d diesel vehicles  by 
2035 .  
In January 2018, the Government published ‘A Green Future: Our 25 Year Plan to Improve 
the Environment’. The 25 year plan confirms the government’s aim to take all possible action 
to mitigate climate change  by continuing to cut GHG  emissions , while adapting to reduce its 
impact through risk assessments and responses to floods, heatwaves, new pests and 
disruption to food production.  East Hampshire District Council  
Climate and Environment Strategy  2020 -2025   Page 7 of 16  East Hampshire District Council in declaring a Climate Emergency , acknowledges the global 
climate crisis  and is committed to working  locally within our remit to implement this strategy  
and play our  part for a sustainable future.  We look forward to working with you as a resident, 
a partner, a community group,  or local enterprise.  
The Council already wor ks with the South Downs National Park Authority, and Hampshire 
County Council to align objectives and co -ordinate resources to tackle climate change. We 
also have  useful working relationships with the 40 parishes and towns in East Hampshire.  
Local context  and key challenges  
East Hampshire is an exceptionally attractive part of southern England with 57% of the 
district lying within the South Downs National Park. It is a popular place in which to live, work 
or visit , with historic market towns and attractive  villages set in beautiful countryside . The 
area’s natural environment and biodiversity  is nationally and internationally recognised and  
protected. The buildings, open spaces and particularly the landscape, all contribute to the 
special character of the ar ea. Together, they provide a rich heritage that adds to the quality 
of life for residents and people who work here and attracts visitors and tourists.  
Some of the key challenges for this strategy in  the district:  
o High levels of ‘out-commuting ’ and car own ership , coupled with  the rural nature of the 
District  means high levels of transport emissions.   
o Energy use in homes represents 24% of carbon emissions.  With 50,000 existing  
homes and  about 3000  more to come in the next 5 years , both retrofitting existing  
homes, and ensuring new homes have high performance standards is important.  
o Tourism  is an important part of our economy, but it can put pressure on the local 
environment .   We need to balance access to the countryside, whilst  protecting 
priority habitats  of nature conservation importance .  
o Farming and agriculture in the area as well as other businesses can be impacted by 
flooding rivers flooding,  but surface water and groundwater flooding  also present 
hazards.  We also need to reduce carbon emissions from f ood production and protect 
the soil.  
o Fresh water supplies are under pressure due to population growth. O ver 80% of the 
District is underlain by a principal aquifer and 40% within a Groundwater Source 
Protection Zone , so the challenge is to limit extraction  of fresh water but maintain our 
targets for new homes.  
How can you be involved?  
You can make  a difference:  
 At home  or at work,  reduce  energy  use by making  buildings  energy  efficient  
 Switch  to renewable  sources  of energy  
 Choose  locally  produced  food,  and reduce  meat  and dairy  consumption  
 Switch  to sustainable  travel:  walk and cycle  more  and save  GHG  emissions,  fly less.  
 Use resources  more  efficiently:  avoid  waste,  reuse  and recycle.  
 Help us increase  tree cover  by planting  a tree near to where  you live 
And you can help to persuade  others  to do the same  by joining  a local group.  East 
Hampshire  District  Council,  with this strategy,  will work  with you to make  the changes  we 
need  to tackle  the climate  emergency.  East Hampshire District Council

East Hampshire in profile . 
East Hampshire is an economically successful area at the heart of South East England.  It lies  
between London and the South Coast . 57% of the district  lies in  the South Downs National 
Park. 
Total land mass: 514 sq. km  
Population:  120,000,  set to grow by 1 0% over the next decade.  
Main towns:  Alton, Petersfield, Whitehill & Bordon  
Large villages:  Horndean, Liphook, Liss and Four Marks  
Rivers  
Three river valleys have an influence on the landform of the East Hampshire District. These 
are the River Itchen, R iver Meon and River Wey. Due to the water level in the chalk falling, the 
source of the River Itchen is now outside of the East Hampshire District.  
Geology  
The East Hampshire District lies at the boundary between the Hampshire Basin to the west 
and the Weald to the east. The geological range is confined to sedimentary rocks of the 
Cretaceous period, mainly Upper, Middle and Lower Chalk of the Hampshire Basin.  
Business and economy  
Business activity ranges from agriculture to information technology  and tou rism 
Number of businesses: more than  5,500                 Total jobs: Over 56,000  East Hampshire District Council  
Climate and Environment Strategy  2020 -2025   Page 9 of 16   
 The Impact  
Without action , rising global temperatures will  increase the frequency and intensity of 
unpredictable weather events.  The natural environment  will be affected, with the loss of 
many species of flora and fauna . Ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide  will 
change and have an adverse impact on  our economy and  food supply chains.  
The IPCC predicts:  
 Climate change is expected to magnify regional differences in Europe’s natural 
resources and assets. Negative impacts will include increased risk of inland flash 
floods, more frequent coastal flooding and increased erosion . 
 Glaciers will retreat and snow cover will reduce affecting winter tour ism. There could 
be extensive loss of plant and animal species .  
 In Southern Europe, climate change is projected to worsen conditions (high 
temperatures and drought) in a region already vulnerable to climate variability and to 
reduce water availability, hy dropower potential, summer tourism and, in general, crop 
productivity.  
 The Panel also anticipate that there will be increased risks to health associated with 
heat waves. In particular for the young and the elderly.  
For East Hampshire,  the impact of climate  change will likely mean hotter drier summers with 
more chance of heat waves and drought and wetter, milder winters with more storms and 
flooding.  
Tackling Climate Change  
Our response to climate change will be managed on two fronts:  
Mitigation:  Taking a ction to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  
Adaptation:  Being prepared for the impacts caused by changes in our climate.  
By developing a coherent approach to mitigation and adaptation, the Council will benefit by 
saving energy  and money, and improv ed environmental performance.  
Our residents  and businesses benefit through an improved quality of life and being more 
prepared for the threats posed by the changing climate  
Through East Hampshire District Council’s  Climate Change Emergency Declaration and th e 
production of this Climate and Environment Strategy, the Council is committed to reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions to net -zero by or before 2050 in line with national legislation.  
You can keep in touch with  the latest initiatives, with  the Council’s ‘Le t’s Talk’ initiative, and 
you can follow progress on the website and on our social media.  Your Council wants to  work 
with everyone for a sustainable future.

2. About Our Strategy  
East Hampshire District Council’s Vision  
East Hampshire District Council will m ake operations  net-zero as soon as reasonably 
practicable or in any case by 2050 . We will work with relevant agencies, partners and 
communities and lobby government to support this ambition . 
We will work with our residents, communit y groups  and enterprises  towards making 
East Hampshire a carbon neutral district . We want the district to deliver its part in the 
wider county, national and international commitments  on reducing emissions , and to 
prepare for the impacts of climate change.   
We want t o achieve a n environmentally sustainable future, to support the local 
economy  and communities. We will work to improve health and wellbeing so that we 
live in harmony with nature . 
 
The Purpose of the Strategy  
The purpose of the strategy is to provide a cle ar statement of the Council’s climate and 
environmen t objectives and to set out how the Council will  address the emergency we face.  
It describes  how we will reduce the Council’s own impact and how , working with our public 
and private sector partners and our communities , we will support the transformation needed 
across the district to tackle the problem.  
Our Strategic Objectives are:  
Strategic objective 1. Climate  
To reduce carbon emissions  in line w ith the Climate Change Act 2008 to be net -zero by 
2050 for all Council services, whether they are delivered by us, or through a partnership. 
More than this, we will use our mandate as a local authority to ensure  sustainable 
development and support our resi dents and enterprises to reduce carbon emissions to net-
zero by 2050.  
Strategic objective 2. Environment  
To protect, improve and enhance our natural environment locally for  biodiversity net gain . 
The ecosystem services provided by the natural environment is our life -support system. We 
will work in collaboration  to enable everyone to play a part in improving biodiversity, air and 
water quality.   
 Scope and  influence of the strategy   
This is a strategy for East Hampshire District Council (rather than the co unty of Hampshire) 
and identifies how we must work with our public and private sector partners and 
communities across Hampshire.   East Hampshire District Council  
Climate and Environment Strategy  2020 -2025   Page 11 of 16  The Council has direct control  on its own activities, but as a local planning authority, has a 
wider reach and is able to influence  residents and enterprises through the planning system 
and its public role , as shown in Figure 1.

Climate and Environment Strategy  2020 -2025   Page 14 of 16  A. Initiatives  to reduce  emissions of the Council ’s estate and operations  
East Hampshire District Council  must  reduce corporate operational emissions to ensure we 
fulfil our Climate Emergency obligations . We will embed sustainability into our policies, 
systems and processes across Council Services . 
The Council’s own operations are only a small proportion of the combined greenhouse gas 
emissions in the district .  However, we in tend to  demonstrate leadership by tackling our own 
emissions as a priority.    
Some significant operations are undertaken by partners on long -term contracts. The council 
can control emissions through procurement specification, and at contract review points.  
Examples include leisure centre operation, and refuse collection.  
A1: Priorities for tackling the emission from Council Estates and operations  
i Reduce emissions from council buildings and vehicles to zero by switching to 
renewable energy and EVs  
ii Harness new technology for a transition to  innovative low -carbon  on-line and cloud -
based working practices and to reduce office space requirements  
iii Mandate  that all business cases, proposal papers and decision -making  include 
criteria to address the climate emergency  
iv Change the culture of the organisation with awareness at all levels  
v Reduce emissions from staff commuting and members attending meetings  
 
A2: Priorities for  tackling the  emissions from our partners and contractors  
i  All new or reviewed contracts will embrace the net -zero target from 2020.  
ii Strategic long -term partners’ emissions will be managed to net -zero within existing 
contracts  e.g. in leisure centres and from refuse collection.  
iii Income earned from the Property portfo lio will be refocused on marketable low -
carbon sustainable buildings . 
 
B:  How we will  influence emissions for East Hampshire’s residents, 
community groups and businesses.  
Influencing the wider area starts with being accountable for what we are doing. We will use 
our channels of communication and networks in the community and across our local 
economy to present everyone with the opportunity to make  the changes we need to see  to 
reach net -zero carbon emission for the whole district.  
B1: Priorities for  engag ing positively and work ing in partnership on climate and 
environment for the community  
i Promote climate  crisis  messages to raise awareness and encourage public 
engagement  to foster change.  East Hampshire District Council  
Climate and Environment Strategy  2020 -2025   Page 15 of 16  ii Extend retrofitting for  existing homes by promoting and extending schemes to 
install energy efficiency  measures like cavity wall insulation and smart 
thermostats.   
iii Engage and facilitate a network of ‘Green groups’ to enable ef fective sharing of 
successful initiatives for behaviour change  
iv Support Parish and Town councils with energy audits of occupied buildings.  
v Allocate 25% of Councillor Grants to support Climate and Environment 
Initiatives.  
  
B2: Priorities for  guiding future development e.g. through the planning system  
i Minimise the climate impact of new development through our Local Plan policies 
and development management decisions  
ii Ensure new builds are meetings their planning permission conditions and 
obligations  
iii Reinforce and implement plans and strategies which support low -carbon 
transport alternatives, including the  Local Cycling  and Walking  Infrastructure 
Plan. 
 
B3: Priorities for providing incentives for businesses and enterprise  
i Encourage the switch  electric vehicle s (EV) including taxis 
ii Climate and Environment criteria and impacts  will influence decisions when 
awarding grants and funding  
iii Identify external funding opportunities  for transition to sustainable and  low-
carbon  practices  
iv Celebrate best practice amongst our local businesses and shops, for instance to 
improve energy efficiency, or innovation  
 
C:    How we will protect and enhance our local  Natural Environment  
 We want to see better and inclusive access and enjoyment of the natural environment 
alongside sustainable management.  
C1: Priorities for Environmental improvements  
i Increase tree cover in the district and see that 120,000 trees are planted in East 
Hampshire , one for every resident.  
  
C2: Priorities for  Community led open green -spaces  
 
i Give communities and residents the opportunity to  take the lead  on land owned 
by East Hampshire District Council  for planting wildflowers and improving local 
biodiversity . Work to identify sources of funding to support this activity, including East Hampshire District Council  
Climate and Environment Strategy  2020 -2025   Page 16 of 16  the Ministry of Housing Communities & Local Government ‘Pocket Parks’ grant 
scheme.  
 
C3: Priorities for  partnership workin g 
i Eliminate use of pesticides in public open spaces.  
ii Improve access and enjoyment of our landscape.  
iii Work closely with large landowners and public bodies for better outcomes for the 
natural environment  
 
4. Delivery, monitoring and engagement  
Progress to date  
Since declaring the Climate and Environment Emergency in July 2019, the Council has 
convened two cabinet liaison panels (CLPs ), made up of members from all parties who have
