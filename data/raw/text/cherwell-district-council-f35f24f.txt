1Taking climate action
2020 has been a year of huge change, with the global COVID-19 pandemic affecting all aspects of society. However, 
it has not changed the need for action on the climate emergency. The key message is clear: we need to take urgent 
action to limit the global rise in temperature to below 1.50C and to avoid the devastating impacts a further rise will 
provoke. This document provides the framework for our local actions here in Cherwell.
There are huge challenges to our ambitions. The scope of our goals for the district are in advance of national and 
regional policy and they will need to be matched by solid leadership from central government and significant changes 
across our communities. Technological, societal and economic conditions within the next decade will provide 
opportunities which we will need to realise and challenges we will need to overcome, whilst fully recognising that we 
have to do things differently and faster. 
Cherwell is well placed to lead on this agenda. Many innovative projects and programmes have already been delivered 
in our district, such as the Eco Bicester initiative, which delivers new housing developments to a zero-carbon and much 
higher environmentally friendly standard, and which has been personally championed by many of us at Cherwell 
District Council. 
We look forward to working with residents and businesses across the district to achieve these goals. COVID has 
underlined the critical importance of the environment and provided us with a unique opportunity to look afresh at 
how we would like to live in the future. It is our responsibility to take forward the environmental benefits we have 
seen during the pandemic and harness the collective will for building back better so that we can achieve real and 
meaningful change. We must do so not only for ourselves, but for future generations to come.

 Recognising a role for everyone
The challenge of addressing climate change 
cannot be underestimated. It requires rapid, 
far-reaching and unprecedented changes in 
all aspects of society. 
Our Climate Action Declaration set out a number of 
commitments covering our two connected roles: 
Transforming our own organisation 
Fully playing our part in enabling a  
zero-carbon Oxfordshire
This framework sets out our approach to 
tackling the Climate Emergency in our priority 
areas for action: our own estate, working with 
suppliers, ensuring our policies enable others 
to make low-carbon choices, and working with 
partners and businesses. It requires new roles 
and collaboration, alongside technical solutions 
and investment. 
The following principles will help us realise and 
maximise the multiple benefits from our action 
on climate change:Transforming

Council
Delivering our commitments takes us well 
beyond our current ways of working both 
in pace and scale - in short we need to do 
things differently.
A dual approach: 
We are implementing a two-year climate action 
mobilisation phase that focuses on priority teams, 
services and policies identified in this framework. 
In tandem, we will kick-start a transition to embed 
climate action across the organisation, so our 
business processes, culture and governance 
systematically drive lower-carbon outcomes. A role for everyone
The council’s vision and values recognise the importance of climate action to our strategic 
priorities. Delivering our commitments will require improving all our staff services and 
embedding the skills, tools and culture to ensure that: 
All our staff have the tools to play their role
Our decisions consider carbon impacts
Directors and managers have a low-carbon vision for their services
All staff act as ambassadors for climate action with our partners.
Our approach will require new relationships with our stakeholders, both new 
expectations and engagement with our supply chain, and a review of where we are 
best placed to support others to take action. 
Holding ourselves to account
We will develop our annual carbon emissions reporting over time to help us monitor, 
evaluate, review and communicate our progress. We will also commit to reporting 
against this climate action framework in order to inform future corporate planning in 
the council.

 Resilience
The council, residents and businesses alike have 
all adapted to the global COVID-19 pandemic. 
We can see that some of these adaptations also 
reduce carbon emissions. As we emerge, you will 
see us maintain and build upon that resilience by:
Developing digital connectivity and skills to 
ensure continuity of services and to reduce 
travel emissions and support improvements to 
our estate
Reducing reliance on grid electricity by 
generating our own clean power and reducing 
demand
Our commitment
As your council we are leading the way and are 
committed to be net carbon neutral from our 
operations and activities by 2030.Transformation
Residents, businesses, staff and our partners are going to see a very different 
council. Virtual meetings will be the norm and, through encouraging active 
travel and pool vehicles, travel by fossil fuelled vehicles will be the exception.

our vision is to shape  
a thriving cherwell
The date for this ambitious target is in advance 
of both national policy and the Oxfordshire 
Energy strategy. We will do our part to achieve 
a zero carbon district by 2030 and lead through 
example. Given the council’s emissions account 
for 0.4% of the overall districts’ emissions, we 
must also recognise our significant influence 
and encourage change in others, whilst 
acknowledging needed changes from central 
government and wider society. 
…in partnership
Together with the Leaders and 
Chief Executives of all Local 
Authorities in Oxfordshire, we
have committed to join 
together to tackle the 
Climate Emergency. 
level of control we have as a district council:
Direct control  e.g. council estate
Strong influence e.g. outsourced contacts, planning decisions
Influence and leadership e.g. planning policy, information campaigns, partnersips
Little to no influence e.g. road transport, industrial emissions, private housing, NHS
…with businesses
Through the Oxfordshire and 
Cherwell Local Industrial 
Strategies, we will work to 
position the district as a  
leader in clean growth.
…for the future
Support policies that enable zero 
carbon developments within the 
Oxfordshire Plan 2050 and the

Alongside a range of local partners Cherwell District 
Council is a signatory to OxLEP’s Oxfordshire 
Energy Strategy. No single partner owns all the 
workstreams in the energy strategy. The low carbon 
investment required is estimated at £300m annually 
with the potential to add £1.35bn and 11,000 jobs to 
the Oxfordshire Economy. The strategy aims to:
• Secure a smart, modern, clean energy infrastructure 
in Oxfordshire
• Reduce emissions in Oxfordshire by 50% by 2030 
setting a pathway to achieving net zero by 2050
• Enhance partnership working across Oxfordshire to 
focus on energy challenges and financing halving emissions

The pandemic has shown both the adaptability of 
communities and a growing desire to ‘build back better’ . 
As we consider our recovery we look to accelerate our 
work on climate action in 3 ways:  
Mainstreaming positive changes for the long term
Seeking climate and connectivity investment to 
support economic recovery and jobs
Focussing on building future resilience:
Supporting a local zero- carbon energy system that 
moves away from reliance on global fossil fuels
Enhancing digital connectivityInvestment
The future will not be built on business-as-usual decision making. Central government 
is reviewing policies and re-prioritising funding, and we will need to do that same. We 
will support investment in full fibre connectivity across Cherwell as a preference to new 
roads. We will prioritise active travel over single-occupancy cars, and adopt planning and 
economic development policies that require the highest design standards from the outset.  
We will create the evidence base to review and re-orientate investment towards the 
objectives of this strategy through supporting a new approach to the Oxfordshire 
Infrastructure Strategy and Cherwell Local Plan. Moving to a zero-carbon Cherwell will also 
require substantial new investment – from the private sector and central government. The 
Cherwell Industrial Strategy and energy and transport innovation projects will help to de-
risk business models to attract private investment. There will be roles for new partnerships 
on investment and ownership models. 
10What we want 
to achieve
Waste and consumption
By participating in county-wide partnerships, supporting residents and 
reviewing our own policies we will: 
Maximise waste reduction and recycling
Target zero growth in waste per person and an increase in the circular economy
Work towards assessing whole system carbon impacts in our waste 
strategy planning and seek to influence national policy.
Transport, connectivity and planning
Through our Local Planning role and work with partners:
Prioritise digital infrastructure and co-working facilities over road 
building: connectivity, enabled by full fibre broadband across 
Oxfordshire will replace the need for many journeys 
Increase the number of people walking and cycling in conjunction with 
the healthy place shaping principles: it will be accessible and normal
Accelerate the rise of electric, shared and autonomous travel
Increasingly deprioritise journeys by single occupancy private car
Promote net zero carbon new developments, with high fabric standards, 
renewables maximised on site and low embodied carbon
Continue to spearhead the development of the nationally important true 
zero carbon Eco-town development.
Buildings and housing
By engaging with partners through OP2050, the Oxfordshire Energy 
Strategy, and Oxfordshire communities we support initiatives that lead to:
Extensive retrofitting of existing buildings
Increase the proportion of work on fuel poverty delivered through improved 
building standards and the Oxfordshire Affordable Warmth Network.
Infrastructure business and systems
Through our planning and economic development roles, and working as 
a regional partner we will develop policy, support others, channel our 
investment and participate in innovation projects for:
Smart, flexible, local renewable generation that enhances local 
resilience identified in strategic planning
Good design that favours zero carbon connectivity and low impact living 
from the outset
Enabling electric charging infrastructure accessible for all residents
Community ownership of energy generation and storage assets
Change in the business community, business networks and development 
of the low carbon supply chain.
Natural Carbon Management
Through our planning policies and as a community and regional partner 
we will ensure Oxfordshire: 
Takes advantage of ‘natural capital’ assets such as soils, woodlands, 
hedges and ponds in order to capture and store carbon and are valued 
by communities
Protects, conserves and enhances carbon capture and storage through 
our natural environments
Support the ambition to double tree cover in Oxfordshire with ‘the right 
tree in the right place’ , as part of a holistic approach to enhance the 
county’s biodiversity and green infrastructure.
