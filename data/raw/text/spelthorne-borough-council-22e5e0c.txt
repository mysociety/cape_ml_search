Spelthorne Borough Council – Climate Change Strategy
The climate crisis is the biggest challenge humanity has faced in generations, we 
need to mitigate any further damage to the planet and adapt to the changes in our 
climate that are already with us, as the recent heatwaves have shown. 
Greenhouse Gases (GHG) cause the air temperature to increase by trapping certain 
wavelengths of radiation in the atmosphere contributing to global heating. Carbon 
dioxide (CO 2) is the dominant GHG and since the period of the industrial revolution, 
humans have increased atmospheric CO 2 on an exponential scale, most of which 
is attributable to fossil fuels. Climate change caused by GHGs is currently and will 
continue to cause further biological, societal, and economical disasters, therefore 
the reduction of these emissions globally is crucial to sustaining life on this planet. 
The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report - Impacts, 
Adaptation and Vulnerability  recognises the scale of the challenge to address the 
climate crisis means rapid and far-reaching changes that are needed in all aspects of 
society, however, it demonstrates that taking action will lead to a more sustainable 
and equitable society. The action required to make these changes may be difficult, 
however, we should focus not on what we can no longer do but on what will be 
gained by residents and the borough by taking action.
Risks of the climate crisis to Spelthorne 
The dangers of climate change are well known; however, it is worth reiterating the 
risks to Spelthorne:
• Drought - July 2022 was the driest on record in the South-East 
• Heat - temperatures recently hit 40.2 at Heathrow on the hottest day on record 
• Wildfires - major incident declared by Surrey Fire and Rescue Service as 
wildfires took hold in July 2022
• Flooding - due to the rising level of the Thames due to sea level rises  as well as 
less frequent but heavier downpours 
• Water security - it has been estimated that the South-East will require an extra 
110 million litres of water per day over the next 35 years  which could affect 
Spelthorne’s reservoirs 
• Food security - drought will have a detrimental knock-on effect on our food 
supplyBenefits of taking action 
Not only do we the Council have a duty to take action to protect Spelthorne and the 
wider ecosystem for future generations to ensure Spelthorne is a liveable thriving 
borough, but there are many benefits to acting including decreasing fuel poverty, 
reducing energy bills, improving air quality and green spaces in the borough for 
residents and creating green jobs. Additionally, by adapting and planning for the 
risks of climate change we can reduce Spelthorne’s exposure to the costs of these 
risks, for example, flood damage to buildings, infrastructure and services.
According to the Climate Change Committee’s recent report “Local Authorities and 
the Sixth Carbon Budget”, local authorities are directly responsible for between 
2- 5% of a local area’s emissions but influence over 33% of a local area’s emissions 
and have many levers that can be used to deliver and influence wider local action 
to reduce emissions and prepare local areas for a changing climate.  Therefore, 
Spelthorne Borough Council has an important role in reducing the emissions of the 
whole of Spelthorne.
Spelthorne Borough Council declared a Climate Emergency on the 14th of October 
2020, publicly prioritising its commitment to tackling the climate crisis. This 
strategy carries on from this declaration and from the work that has already been 
accomplished, examples of which are listed below:- 
• Installation of solar PV arrays across Council owned buildings including, the Main 
Operations Depot, Knowle Green West Wing Development, Laleham Nursery, 
Staines & Fordbridge Community Centres
• Ultra Low Energy Passivhaus Leisure Centre in Staines is being built
• Council’s fleet now has 2 EV (electric vehicle) pool cars, 2 EV vans and 2 EV 
mopeds
• EV charging points installed at main operations buildings including Knowle 
Green, White House Depot and Laleham Nursery.
• 8 EV charge points installed at 2 Multi-storey car parks in Staines-upon-Thames 
• LED lighting upgrades carried out throughout Council offices

Spelthorne Borough Council’s baseline emissions 
It is important to note that emissions are calculated as carbon dioxide equivalent 
(CO2e), which is a term used to combine the seven most threatening gases that 
have the highest global warming potential. This includes carbon dioxide, methane, 
nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride and 
nitrogen trifluoride.
Spelthorne Borough Council’s baseline emissions for 2019/2020 for Scope 1 and 2 
emissions were 1,194 tCO2e, the breakdown of these emissions can be seen in Tables 
1 and 2.
Table 1 Carbon emissions by source for Spelthorne Borough Council’s operations in 2019/20Net Zero target
A Net Zero target refers to reaching net zero carbon emissions by a nominated year 
but differs from zero carbon, which requires no carbon to be emitted at all. Net Zero 
refers to balancing the amount of emitted greenhouse gases with the equivalent 
emissions that are either offset or sequestered through rewilding and tree planting 
or carbon capture and storage. The Council will have a greater focus on reducing 
carbon emissions as much as possible and only using offsetting and sequestering 
techniques for those hard to reduce emissions.
Spelthorne Borough Council plans to be Net Zero for Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 
2030. This is in line with Surrey County Council’s Greener Futures Delivery Plan.
It is estimated that there could be up to 283 tCO 2e from hard to reduce sources that 
will be unavoidable by 2030 that will need to be offset, the Council will look to offset 
through a large renewable scheme, protection and improvement of the borough’s 
carbon sinks and tree planting schemes. Emissions Source Scope Tonnes CO₂e % Split

How Spelthorne Borough Council will reduce emissions
How the Council is going to reduce emissions is set out below by actions that need 
to be undertaken. While the Council wants to reduce our emissions, we also realise 
the important need to plan for the changing climate, therefore adaptation is also 
covered in this plan, recent heatwaves have shown some of those changes are 
already here.
While we are aiming to get to Net Zero by 2030 for Scope 1 & 2 we realise the large 
impact of our Scope 3 emissions, which by their nature are much hard to track and 
reduce. Therefore, we will also be taking several actions to reduce our Scope 3 
emission and create a more robust reporting system.
The Action Plan has been divided into nine sections that need to be tackled: - 
Buildings and Operations 
Transport 
Finance
Sustainable Development
Economy
Waste
Communities 
Biodiversity
Adaptation
It is an ambitious plan, that will require the buy in of all staff, which will be reviewed 
every 6 months, but the risk of the climate crisis is such that it requires bold action. 
It is important to establish Science Based Targets, meaning that targets align 
with Earth’s limits and societal sustainability goals as well as being measurable, 
actionable, and time-bound objectives. It is important to note that as the Council’s 
emissions reporting becomes more accurate, emissions may rise to reflect true 
emissions.
The Council intends to reduce our emissions to 40% of our baseline year by 2025 to 
717 tCO 2e, saving 477 tCO 2e equivalent to removing 280 cars from the road. In 2025 
we will review our emissions and targets and aim to reduce emissions further to be 
Net Zero by 2030. 
We will also monitor and report our progress against our targets while collaborating 
with Surrey County Council on reporting and actions.  While the Net Zero target is 
for our Scope 1 & 2 emissions, we will be working to monitor and reduce our Scope 3 
emissions as well.Scope 1 & 2 CO 2e Trajectory
