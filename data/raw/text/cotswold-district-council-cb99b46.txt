 1 Foreword   
 
 
Climate change is complex .  Few people have time to research the science , and not everyone 
regularly thinks, and talks to others, about it .   However opinion research sho ws that a majority of 
people in the UK acknowledge that climate change is real, man -made, already being felt in this 
country, going to affect everybody, and is making them worried.    
The Covid -19 crisis has demonstrated that people pull together in an emer gency, and that change 
can happen very fast when it has to.  Nobody wanted the global emissions reduction that 
accompanied the Covid -19 lockdown to happen for that reason .  Nonetheless the lockdown reduced 
noise and emissions, improved air quality and rein forced our appreciation of our beautiful Cotswold 
landscape, which will have helped the mental health of many during a very trying period.  Research 
shows that very few people want to go back to “normal” after the worst of the crisis is over,  and 
recognise  that this is an important moment of change.  
The science is long settled .  Climate heating is man -made , and net g reenhouse gas  emissions must 
be cut to zero (and eventually reversed).  A ll major agencies agree that the climate crisis, and the 
closely related ecological  crisis, is the biggest medium - and long -term threat to our world and all our 
livelihoods.   These crises, and the strength and effectiveness of our collective response to them, is 
the defining context of the next few decades, and indeed much further into the future.   
Taking action on the climate c risis means two things.  Mitigating climate change involves reducing 
emissions of the main gas that causes global heating, carbon dioxide (CO 2).  Adapting to climate 
change involves managing the  physical, economic and social impacts of already inevitable climate 
disruption .  Both have to be done in parallel.    
Our success in mitigating climate breakdown will play out over the medium - and long -term 
measured against a human lifetime, and a split se cond measured against human history.  The 
benefits of taking ambitious action on the climate emergency , and the nature recovery challenge,  
are clear.  Preserving a liveable climate protect s future generations, makes us healthier, and 
preserve s the countrys ide.  It can also create new jobs in growth industries, reduce waste, improve 
air quality, build  fairness, and preserve and improve natural habitat, wildlife, and our enjoyment of 
it. 
 
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  7 
 The threat of a rapidly changing climate requires a g lobal response.  Bu t action is also required at 
every level, from international institutions to governments to individuals .  Driving down greenhouse 
gas emissions will require not less than every human activity to change, but often for the better, 
from travel to energy generation to food to what we buy to how we use energy in homes and 
workplaces.  
The UK has a legally binding target to reduce net emissions to zero by 2050.  That sounds a long way 
off, but children leaving prim ary school today will just be in mid -career  by that date, perhaps with 
children of their own .  Climate models suggest that unchecked climate change will cause repeated 
economic shocks, create public health crises and huge pressure on our health system, und ermine 
food production and drive increased conflict and mass migration. If the world , and that includes us,  
doesn’t take determined, rapid and far -reaching action, those primary school children’s lives will be 
much harder , much less secure  and much less hopeful  than the lives of people reading this . 
By its nature the climate crisis will, increasingly, impact every aspect of the lives of Cotswold 
residents, and every aspect of the work of the Council.  Our responses to the climate crisis therefore 
do not fit  into a single policy area.  The challenge we are taking on is to integrate the climate 
emergency response , and the nature recovery challenge,  into every aspect of the Council’s work.  
Cotswold District Council itself has neither the powers nor the pocket t o enable the whole District to 
rapidly reduce emissions and adapt to climate change.  Therefore a  small part only of the actions can 
be taken by the Council itself , with Council funds .  The much bigger challenge, which will deliver 
much bigger benefits for  all, will be leveraging external knowledge, help and finance, and working 
with, supporting and promoting the  carbon reduction  ideas, efforts, and investment by individual 
citizens, and organisations of every type  in the District .  
In keeping with the Coun cil’s unanimously adopted Declaration of a Climate Emergency in July 2019, 
this climate strategy is the starting point for a decade of action by Cotswold District Council, to rise 
to the urgent challenge of the climate emergency.  
Responding to the climate emergency is  a collective effort from which everyone gains.  This is a 
challenge we all must rise to , or explain to today’s primary school children why we didn’t.

 2 At a glance  
o This strategy sets out high level principles, imperatives, targets  and action  areas for 
responding to the climate emergency  (both as a Council and more widely for the district as 
a whole) for the ten year period 2020 -2030 , consistent with the Council’s  unanimous 
declaration of a climate emergency in July 2019.  
o The climate crisis, and the related ecolog ical crisis, present profound threat s to the 
prospects and livelihoods of all Cotswold district residents, but particularly our young 
people , and future generations beyond them .  There is an urgent imperative to act.  
o The Covid -19 cris is has shown  that people pull together in an emergency, and that 
change can happen very fast  when it has to .  We have a chance to make permanent 
changes for the better, as we  recover from the virus.  
o Cotswold District  as a whole emitted 605,000 tonnes of gr eenhouse gases (CO 2e) in 2018 , 
equivalent to the emissions from burning about one and a half Cirencester leisure centre -
sized pools of diesel every day.   A bit less than half is from road travel (diesel and petrol), a 
third is from gas and other fuels for heating homes and workplaces , and 15% is from 
electricity for homes and workplaces .  Some carbon is also sequestered (stored) in 
grasslands , woodland  and well managed soils . 
o The Council’s own corporate emissions for 2019 -20 were 2,750 tonnes, or 0.4% of the 
district a s a whole.  Half is from diesel used by the waste fleet, a quarter is from gas for 
heating council buildings and leisure centres , and a quarter is from electricity.  
o We propose to develop an emissions reduction target and pathway for the whole  
District .  This will extremely challenging, and outside the direct control or resources of the 
Council.  The Council will use the target to focus discussions with key stakeholders to 
increase commitment and se ek joined -up solutions.  
o The Council’s target f or its own net emissions is to reduce by two thirds from the current 
level by 2030, and to zero by 2045 , with no reliance on offsetting.   This is a challenging 
target, and how the Council organises itself post Covid -19 will affect progress  towards it . 
o The organising principles of this strategy  include being bold ; providing leadership ; being 
evidence  based;  looking for the biggest effect s and co -benefits; linking mitigation with 
adaptation and linking the climate and ecological emergencies; working in partne rship; 
encouraging citizen leadership; and leveraging external help and internal strengths.  
o The Council  has to work within the constraints of its levers of influence.   The Council  has 
a high level of c ontrol over some actions that will have only a small emissions impact 
(relative to the district as a whole ), but only a low level of control over other actions that 
could have a much larger impact .  Our leadership role is therefore crucial, in using our own 
commitments and  actions to help others to realise the impact they can have.   
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  9 
 o Priority action areas are broken down by scope  of Council leverage.  Action areas are  
divided into  direct control  (eg council’s own operations), indirect control  (eg 
commissioning), place shaping  (eg LP policies), enabling  (eg proactively helping others to 
take action) and engaging  (eg communicating and consulting)

 3 About this strategy  
The purpose of this high level strategy  is to:  
o Justify why the climate emergency is a top Council priority ; 
o formalise a high level of ambition in taking action on climate, commensurate with the 
Council’s declaration of a climate emergency in July 2019  and an ecological emergency in 
July 2020 ; 
o set out  the high level principles that underpin the development and exec ution of the 
strategy ; 
o identify the scale and sources of emissions from the district and from council operations;  
o identify the points of greatest leverage in bringing about carbon reductions in the district ; 
o set direction and identify priorit y action areas .  
The timeframe of this strategy is 2020 -2030, reflecting the importance of the crucial ‘Decade to 
Make a Difference’ – the ten years in which the world must see annual greenhouse gas  emissions 
stop rising, plateau, and start falling steeply, if we a re to have a chance of limiting global climate 
breakdown.  
Climate science, technology innovation , public understanding, sentiment and behaviour changes, the 
international and national policy environment for climate action, and the scientific evidence on 
greenhouse gas  emissions and climate impacts, are all changing fast.  For this reason it is likely to be 
necessary  for this strategy to be thoroughly reviewed during the ten year period, at least at the mid 
point in 2025, if not sooner.    
At the review point  we must expect the evidence of climate crisis to be starker still than it is today.  
It is very likely that climate scientists will confirm that it will be practically impossible for global 
heating to be contained below at least 2 degrees Celsius, and pro bably very significantly higher.  This 
will have implications for the climate adaptation actions the Cotswolds needs to take, and may spur 
the adoption of even more ambitious carbon reduction targets than are suggested in this strategy . 
The strategy does n ot identify specific actions to be delivered over the decade, but is a high level 
direction find er which identifies broad priority areas for action.  Specific action plans and initiatives 
will be proposed, approved and reported separately from this strategy , and individual actions 
referenced in Appendix  3 are illustrative only , and are neither a comprehensive list nor a limit to 
what the Council can and will do.

 4 The imperative for action  
4.1 International progress on tackling climate change  
In Paris in 2015, the international community achieved a breakthrough by reaching  the Paris 
Agreement  under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  process.  
The Agreement  stated the aim to “hold the increase in the global averag e temperature to well -
below 2°C above pre -industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit  the temperature increase to 
1.5°C” .  Global heating is already over 1 °C. 
In 2018 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the Special Report on 
1.5°C2.  The report showed that risks rose significantly between 1.5°C and 2°C in terms of damage to 
ecosystems (species loss, extinction and ecosystems services vital to humans), and extreme weather 
events (heat extremes, heavy precipitation, droughts).  The report also showed that risks to health, 
livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to 
increase with global warming of 1.5°C and increase further with 2°C.  
The UK has consistently been a global leader i n enshrining carbon reduction commitments in law, 
and the Climate Change Act 2008 now commits the country to reducing n et emissions to zero by 
2050 .  The UK has submitted its national emissions reduction commitment to the UN FCCC , alongside 
all other partic ipatin g countries . 
The problem is that , taken together, these individual national commitments do not come close to 
the level of emissions reduction required to achieve the limits set in the Paris Agreement ( Figure 1).  
If emissions are reduced in line with stated commitments (and that itself must be questioned), it 
would lead to global heating of around 2.4°C - 3.8°C by 21003.  Heating at this level can only be 
described  as catastrophic.

4.2 UK progress on tackling climate change  
The Committee on Climate Change 2020 annual report to Parliament4 makes clear that, whilst the 
UK has met its carbon budgets in previous years, it is not on track to meet future ones .  This is 
exacerbated by the tightening of the UK’s carbon reduction target to net zero by 2050 since earlier 
carbon budgets were set.  
The report shows that only a limited number of steps have been taken over the past year to support 
the transition to a net -zero economy and improve the UK’s resilience to the impacts of climate 
change, and much remains to be done.  
Regarding the challenge of post -Covid recovery, the report highlights five clear investment priorities: 
low-carbon retrofits and buildings that are fit for the future; tree planting, peatland restoration and 
green infrastructure; strengthening energy networks; improved infrastruc ture to make it easy for 
people to walk, cycle, and work remotely ; moving towards a circular economy.   Many of these 
priorities relate as much to Cotswold District as they do to the country as a whole.  
The report also identifies opportunities to support th e transition and the recovery by investing in the 
UK’s workforce, and in lower -carbon behaviours and innovation through, eg, reskilling and retraining 
programmes, promoting climate -positive behaviours, and targeted science and innovation funding.

 4.3 UK climat e impacts to date   
The Met Office’s 2020 State of the Climate annual report5 shows "an undeniable warming trend for 
the UK".   2019 was the 12th warmest year in a series  over 135 years, and the 24th in a  series over 
360 years.  Four national high temperatur e records were set  in 2019: a new all -time record of 38.7  
degC during a brief but exceptional heatwave, a new winter  record  (by a large margin)  of 21.2 degC, 
a new December record of 18.7 degC, and a new February minimum temperature record  of 13.9 degC. 
2019 had the second warmest February over 135 years.  
All of the top 10 warmest years on record have occurred in the last 17 years.  2020 will not break this 
trend.  The most recent deca de (2010 –2019) has been on aver age 0.3 degC warmer than the previous 
decade, an d 0.9degC warmer than 1961 –1990.  
Severe f looding affected the UK in 2019, and will continue to be a significant risk, exacerbated by 
climate change.  Winters in the most recent decade have been on average 5% wetter than the 
previous decade, and 12% wetter than 1961 -1990, however there are long term natural variations 
that may account for some of this change.  
To date, storms have not been a major impact from climate change.  There are  no significant trends 
in storminess (maximum gust speeds ) over the last fi ve decades . 
The Woodland Trust monitors how the seasons are being impacted by climate change, and reported 
that warmer weather and milder spring temperatures in 2019 saw the first leaves appear on trees 
almost 10 days earlier than the baseline period.  The  Trust’s chief executive, Darren Moorcroft, 
warned that these seasonal shifts "could have dire impacts further down the food chain". "Our trees, 
and all the wildlife they support, are on the frontline of climate change," he said. "This is a stark 
reminder of the need to take immediate action on climate change."  
4.4 UK future climate impacts  
The Climate Change Act requires government to produce a periodic climate change risk assessment.  
The last was 20176 (due for update in 2022) and showed a generally high level of risk in most 
categories reviewed  (Figure 2).  In the three years since that assessment, atmospheric CO 2 
concentration has continued to rise.

4.4.1 Heat and precipitation  
The Met Office’s UK Climate Projections (UKCP)7 programme provides  the most up -to-date 
assessment of how the climate of the UK may change over the 21st century.   The headline findings 
for projected future temperatures are given in ( Figure 3) and for future precipitatio n in (Figure 4). 
By 2070 temperatures of every season will be higher, hot summer days will be more common and 
the frequency of hot spells will rise from one every four years, to four every year.

By 2070 winters will be wetter and summers drier.  Extreme rainfall events will increase by 25%, and 
rainfall will be higher intensity, carrying a higher ris k of localised pluvial and fluvial flooding.

4.4.2 Excess summer deaths  
Public Health England (PHE) reports 892 excess deaths in 65+ year olds over three heatwave events 
in 2019.  The re were more excess deaths in 2019 than in 2018 (863 deaths) and 2017 (778 deaths), 
but fewer  than in 2016 (908 deaths), 2006 (2,323 deaths) and 2003 (2,234 deaths).10  PHE states that 
“Heatwaves are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity as a result of climate change. The 
health impacts of these events can be significant particularly for vulnerable populations when excess 
mortality can occur.”11 
The House of C ommons Environmental Audit Committee report Heatwaves: Adapting to climate 
change  (2018)12 made clear that heatwaves will increasingly threaten health, wellbeing and 
productivity.  The Met Office predicts that heatwaves of a similar intensity  to those in 20 03 and 
2006, which led to over 2,000 excess deaths  each , will occur every other year by the 2040s. The 
average number of heat -related deaths in the UK is expected to more than triple to 7,000 a year by 
the 2050s.  
We do not have data for excess summer deat hs in Cotswold District, but we should note that the age 
profile of the District is higher than the UK average.  The EAC report points out that o lder people are

 particularly vulnerable and suffer increased fatalities from cardiac and respiratory disease du ring 
heatwaves.  
There is a need for increased public understanding of the risk from heat.  The EAC report references 
the (then) Minister for Public Health and Primary Care recognis ing that the public tend to see 
heatwave alerts as “barbecue alerts.”   The E AC report references government’s view that local 
authorities have a “huge role” in adapting to heatwaves, and this is likely to lead to additional 
responsibility and cost for CDC in the medium term.    
4.5 Evidence of citizens ’ views  
Whilst it has not been pos sible to consult widely with Cotswold District residents on the climate 
crisis to date, national and local exercises involving randomly sampled members of the population 
demonstrate a strong appetite for local authorities as well as national government to prioritise the 
climate crisis and take determined  action.  
The UK Climate Assembly13, commissioned by six Select Committees of the House of Commons, used 
stratified random sampling to ensure that the 110 members of the public taking part were  randomly 
chosen  but fairly and fully represent ative of  the UK population in terms of age, gender, level of 
qualification, ethnicity, location, whether urban or rural, and their attitudes to climate change.  
Assembly members were given access to expert opinion and data on climate change, presented by 
some of the most respected experts in their field.  An interim report from the National Assembly, 
focused on the challenge of building back better after the pandemic, showed that 79% o f assembly 
members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that, “Steps taken by the government to  help the economy 
recover should be designed to help achieve net zero” .   93% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ 
or ‘agreed’ that, “As lockdown eases, government,  employers and/or others should take steps to 
encourage lifestyles to change to be more  compatible with reaching net zero.”  
Ipsos Mori conducted a similarly rigorous A ssembly commissioned by Oxford  City Council14, triggered 
by the Council’s declaration of a c limate emergency.  The question for the Assembly was “The UK has 
legislation to reach ‘net zero’ by 2050. Should Oxford be more proactive and seek to achieve ‘net 
zero’ sooner than 2050?” After examining the evidence, 90% of the randomly selected and 
repre sentative participants said ‘yes’.  
Other headline recommendations from the Assembly members were that Oxford should be a leader 
in tackling the climate crisis; enhanced biodiversity was central to the City’s overall ‘net zero’ vision 
along with more cyclin g, walking, and public transport, and far fewer cars; the buildings sector 
should adopt improved building standards, widespread retrofitting, and more domestic and non -
domestic energy needs should be met by sustainable sources.

ed  
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  17 
 It is also worth noting how Assembly members were perturbed by the extent to which the burden of 
change was – in their eyes – being placed on individuals.  The council was challenged to 
communicate a shared vision and strategy to reaching ‘net zero’ that shows the roles played by loc al 
and national government, businesses, and individuals.  
As more Citizens’ Assembly exercises are undertaken by Local Authorities, a consistent picture is 
emerging that residents, when presented with the facts  of the climate emergency , consistently call 
on local leaders to respond more determinedly and raise the ambition.  
4.6 Speed of change and the need for local leadership  
There are positive signs of change.  Public awareness of the threat of climate change is growing, and 
behaviours are changing, giving gre ater legitimacy to political decisions to invest public monies and 
make changes to infrastructure and policies that affect citizens’ daily lives.  
The electricity system is changing fast.  National Grid and the energy regulator Ofgem have said that 
a fully zero carbon electricity grid is now possible, and new technology innovations are happening 
with increasing speed.  Electric vehicles are the only growing segment of the car market.  
Some 70% of  councils have now made declarations of a climate emergency, and  many have 
developed strategies and action plans to back them up. In 2021 the UK will host the 26th Conference 
of the Parties to the UNFCCC – CoP26, delayed by Covid -19 and scheduled for Glasgow.  CoP26 is a 
pivotal event, which it is hoped will deliver ev en greater commitment and action than CoP22 in Paris 
in 2015.  
Nonetheless overall progress is unsteady and needs to be much faster.  Whilst international 
agreements are important, leadership at local level must be even more committed.

 5 Challenges, oppor tunities and risks  
5.1 Challenges  
The climate crisis, and our collective response to it, is the defining context for humankind for the 
foreseeable future.  What we do, or don’t do, over the next few decades will have far -reaching 
consequences.  
A challenge for all organisations is to find how to move climate change from a stand -alone, ring -
fenced issue, to a mainstreamed, integrated issue which is universal and embedded across all 
thought, assumptions and decisions as automatically as any long -established issue like cost 
effectiveness, welfare, or health and safety.  
Rising to the challenge of the climate crisis will cost money.  The key reason we are in the climate 
crisis in the first place is because our economic systems consistently failed to price in externali ties – 
that is, ignored the true long -term cost of exploiting carbon resources laid dow n over geological 
timescales  (despite full scientific understanding of the danger).   
There will have to be a universal paradigm shift in understanding in every part of society that the  
costs we have to bear now to try and limit the damage we have already done , and prevent it 
becoming much worse, is simply the cost we decided not to bear historically when we were enjoying 
the benefits of abundant cheap fossil fuels.  That historic profligacy and willful ignorance of climate 
science has now come back to bite us  and future generations , and we must now be prepared to pay, 
even if those costs clash  with established ways of thinking about cost effectiveness  and return on 
investment . 
This is a challenge for any organisation that chooses to take a leadership position, since many of 
these messages and consequences are naturally unpalatable to many.   There is intrinsic unfairness in 
this and future generations having to pay an extremely high price for the lack of care of previous 
generations.  Nonetheless the understandin g of the climate crisis is quickly becoming more 
universal, with much of the impetus  coming from large private sector organisations .  Local authority 
leadership now can help accelerate the necessary change.  
5.2 Opportunities  
Alongside the challenges will be op portunities, not least in the creation of new investment, training 
and jobs, and in the beneficial physical and social consequences of adopting new low -carbon ways of 
living and working.  
Government spending to build back better after the Covid -19 crisis pr esent s an opportunity to invest 
in green infrastructure such as active travel routes.   
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  19 
 The Council, through its Local Plan review, forthcoming sustainable transport strategy, green 
economic development plan and other means will seek to get ahead of, and mak e sure that the 
district can be a net beneficiary of, the profound changes that are necessary across all of society.  
The opportunities for the district may include, for example, new employment in businesses servicing 
new green industries such as whole -hous e retrofit of low carbon technology to minimise 
householder running costs, new ways of doing agriculture than emphasise local supply chains,  and 
green infrastructure investments .  Others will be jobs associated with renewable energy generation , 
building a network of electric vehicle  changing points , building a network of safe and attractive cycle 
route s, and all the associated economic benefits / cost savings that would come with improved 
health and wellbeing and tourism.  
5.3 Risks  
There are significant potenti al near - and medium -term risks to the delivery of this strategy.  
5.3.1 Planning White Paper  
If changes are made to the planning system in line with the intentions set out in the MHCLG white 
paper Planning for the Future (August 2020), it will probably severely r estrict the Council’s ability to 
set local policy on carbon and energy efficiency of new developments.  It has already been noted 
that the white paper pushes the requirement of zero carbon development off to 2050 (compared to 
its long -abandoned original ta rget date of 2016), so immediately undermining the ambition of many 
Councils to push for much faster adoption of this benchmark.  
5.3.2 Recession  
The UK is entering a period of recession, with the biggest fall in GDP of any G7 country, in the 
context of the deepe st global economic downturn since the 1930s.  The fallout of the pandemic, and 
the speed of economic recovery for this country are unknown, but a sustained recession will 
undermine confidence and the ability to deliver projects of every type.   
5.3.3 Covid -19 
Mos t commentators predict that we will have to learn to live with the virus .  If the kind of short term 
changes we have made to adapt to the virus become permanent, it will affect many aspects of how 
we live, shop, travel and work, and therefore will change t he assumptions underpinning the 
investment case for low carbon projects .   
Many uncertainties hang over how and whether Covid -19 it can be defeated .  These include the 
eventual uptake rate of a vaccine (once available), possible changes to the virus itself , increased 
understanding about its long -term effects, and indeed the emergence of similar global pandemics 
fuelled, partly, by our over -exploitation of the natural world.    
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  20 
 5.3.4 Unitarisation  
Whilst still highly uncertain in process, timeframe and outcome, ther e may be pressure to move 
Gloucestershire towards a unitary authority.  The risk is two -fold; in the medium term is the 
uncertainty that any such change introduces to the long -term stability of CDC as a decision maker on 
local policy and a counterparty to low carbon projects, and in the longer term the potential for a 
future unitary authority to dilute the low carbon ambition expressed by CDC.  
   
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  21 
 6 Organising principles  
In determining and executing our strategy and prioritising the types of action we can take,  we will 
seek to be guided by the following high level organising principles.  
Be bold and ambitious; accept and manage risks    
The scale of the global climate crisis, and its forthcoming effects on Cotswold district, leave no room 
for timidity or uncertain ty.  This was spelled out in the Council’s declaration of a Climate Emergency.  
Responding to the climate emergency requires the Council to take, and learn to manage, a level of 
economic and political risk in taking actions , and helping others to take acti ons, which are 
commensurate with the scale of the emergency.  
Provide leadership    
The Council’s climate emergency declaration commits the Council to providing leadership within the 
District, and by extension more widely, to help all stakeholders to underst and the scale of the 
emergency more quickly than they might otherwise have done, and to embolden and encourage 
those already choosing to take action.  The climate crisis already is, and will increasingly in the 
future, affect everyone.  Society has reacted  far too slowly to this threat to date, and at this moment 
continues to react far too slowly.  We cannot wait until unequivocal con sensus is reached on the 
right course of action – leadership is needed from all stakeholders  now .   
Follow the evidence    
A district council cannot also be a climate science expert.  However we will access highly reputable 
interpretations of the rapidly evolving science on climate breakdown, and what it means for 
Cotswold  District, provided by bodies like the Committee on Climat e Change and the Met Office.  We 
will also track and take account of the evidence of fast, deep and wide -scale change in both public 
attitudes and corporate decision making in favour of a net zero carbon future, to be achieved sooner 
than the present natio nal goal of 2050 . 
Determine and promote a stretching district -wide emissions reduction target and pathway  
Most Local Authorities that have declared a climate emergency have also adopted area -wide 
reduction targets, often more ambitious than the UK’s curren t legally binding target of net zero 
territorial greenhouse gas  emissions by 2050.  Many have not made clear how such a target may be 
reached, which stakeholders must be involved, and the role of the council in achieving it.   
We acknowledge  the limits to the Council’s direct  powers and influence , and will conduct research 
to determine a district -wide science -based emissions reduction target based on the level of 
reduction required  to contribute fully to meeting the Paris Climate Accord, and which also seek s a 
fair allocation of effort and reward across all communities.  We will identify actions that may be 
taken by stakeholders across the district, and the emissions reduction pathway that those actions 
could deliver.   
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  22 
 Focus on the biggest wins    
We will s eek actions that deliver the largest greenhouse gas  reduction impact, and which focus on 
the largest emissions categories in the District (agriculture, road transport, heating building s) as well 
as the largest categories of our own emissions (waste fleet fuel , gas for heating).  We will resist the 
temptation to focus on actions with high public relations  value but small emissions value, even 
though actions delivering large reductions are hard and require us to work creatively with many 
other stakeholders.   
Connect mitigation and adaptation    
Whilst climate mitigation and adaptation are separate tasks, wherever possible we will s eek actions 
that link the two, ideally having a useful impact on both objectives simultaneously.  
Connect the climate and ecological em ergencies   
The Council voted to declare an ecological emergency  in July 2020 , putting ecological issues at the 
heart of the Council’s actions to deliver nature recovery across the distric t.  We recognise that the 
two emergencies are intimately linked and wherever possible we will seek actions that help to tackle 
both objectives.  
Maximise co -benefits   
In taking climate action ourselves, and supporting others to take action, we will identify an d seek to 
maximise the co -benefits of those actions, and wherever possible align these with the Council’s 
other priorities and statutory responsibilities.  Whilst the primary focus of climate actions will be on 
adaptation and emissions reduction, there wil l be co -benefits not measured in tonnes of carbon, 
which may include, among others, economic regeneration, improved air quality, better public 
health, increased enjoyment of and access to nature, new employment and skills, investment 
opportunities, reduced  fuel poverty and greater community spirit.  
Deliver fairness    
As well as the long -term benefit of helping to assure a liveable climate for Cotswold residents, and 
the potentially multiple associated co -benefits of climate actions, there will also inevitab ly be 
additional cost, disruption, changes to the status quo and changes to behaviours and expectations.  
These changes will touch everyone in the country, from individual citizens to every sort of 
organisation.   
Public attitude research consistently show s that most people hold fairness as a high principle when 
enacting necessary change.  At local level this will mean thinking carefully about where the burden 
of costs and changes falls, seeking to protect the most vulnerable and least well -off (who will 
anyway be most impacted by forthcoming climate change), and providing leadership to show the 
justification for necessary changes.  
  
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  23 
  
Work in partnership    
As stated elsewhere, Cotswold District Council has neither the powers nor the pocket to deliver 
emission s reduction across the district at the scale necessary.  However we will be able to work in 
partnership with stakeholders across the district to share information, develop new ideas, align our 
climate objectives and communications, co -invest, and seek new collaborative opportunities for 
emissions reduction projects.   
The Council will also do everything within its power to encourage the developers of any large scale 
or infrastructure projects, which have significant climate impact, to take a courageous lead  in 
voluntarily aiming at the best possible emissions target, consistent with the scale of the climate 
emergency that faces us all.  
Encourage and support citizen leadership   
The Council’s declaration of a climate emergency in July 2019 stated the aim of cr eating a citizens’ 
climate panel to help guide the Council’s actions and to better link with communities on the climate 
emergency.  As with virus pandemics, systemic threats of any kind bring people together since 
collective action is essential where every one is at risk, and everyone benefits from the solutions.  
Climate change is many orders of magnitude larger than Covid -19 in its medium - and long -term 
damaging impacts.   
The climate crisis is universal and therefore awareness of it, and responses to it, must be shared as 
widely as possible.  We will enable and support individual Cotswold residents and existing and new 
community -based groups with a focus on the climate and ecological emergencies, to own the 
problem as well as the solution, provide local le adership which reinforces the Council’s aims, and 
encourage faster and wider response to the emergencies among all communities in the District.    
Replicate and share good ideas  
To be efficient with limited resources we will avoid re -inventing the wheel .  As the country wakes up 
to the depth of the climate and ecological crises there is a burgeoning range of ideas, support and 
opportunities for collaboration, all of which can reduce risk for the Council and other stakeholders, 
speed up actions, and maximise  effectiveness.   
Responding to the climate emergency is becoming mainstreamed, and being part of networks such 
as the Countryside Climate Network, which Cotswold District Council is a founder member of (an 
initiative of the UK100 network Local Government leaders focused on climate and clean energy 
policy), is just one channel for accessing and sharing these ideas.  To tackle the climate crisis it is no 
longer necessary to carry innovation risks alone.  
 
 
  
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  24 
 Leverage external resources  
Commensurate with taking controlled risks and collaborating with others, we will seek to leverage 
external finance, expertise, ideas, support and projects , to magnify the impact of what we would 
otherwise achieve with our own much more limited resources.  
Leverage internal strengths  
Whilst Cotswold District Council has practical constraints of tangible resources such as finance, land, 
buildings and human resources, it has important intangible assets which can be leveraged to support 
others taking action.  Th e Council is a stable long -term body, and therefore able to enter long term 
contracts that help to de -risk, and therefore reduce the costs of, projects such as renewable 
generation.   
The Council has long -term relationships with many stakeholders, a close understanding of the 
settlements in the District, and is a trusted ‘brand’.  These can be leveraged to help accelerate the 
uptake of new initiatives such as green electricity switching, rooftop PV investment, electric vehicle 
uptake and home energy retrofi t, even when the Council itself is not the implementing body.

 7 Greenhouse gas emissions from Cotswold District  
7.1 The national context  
As the graph of UK territorial emissions15 shows  (Figure 5), thirty years ago the UK’s biggest 
greenhouse gas emitter was industry, closely followed by power generation.  Third on the list , with 
half the emissions of industry and power,  was vehicles  and buildings.  Today the story is  very  
different.   
 
 
Industrial emissions have dropped significantly – both through greater efficiency, but also because 
globalisation has pushed a lot of man ufacturing overseas, and those  consumption  emissions – that 
is, emissions from manufacturing  and transport elsewhere in the world, associated with the things 
we buy - are not recorded in this graph.   
The really dramatic change is in power generation.  The  increasing use of gas  (displac ing coal) from 
the 1990s onwards , and more recently the huge growth in renewable energy generation, has slashed 
emissions from power generation by three quarters.  That’s impressive, and indeed since renewable 
energy is now more cost effective  than thermal generation (that is, burning coal, oil and gas to make 
electricity) , it is foreseeable that we could eventually have a near -100% renewable powered grid in 
this country.

Figure 5: UK territorial (production) greenhouse gas emissions, 1990 -2018   
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  26 
 The really stubborn emitters are vehicles and buildin gs.  Vehicle emissions have flatlined for thirty 
years, and is now the biggest single emissions category. The uptake of electric vehicles has started, 
but has not yet had an impact on emissions, and indeed market forces (such as the popularity of 
sport uti lity vehicles ) has actually moved the graph the wrong way in recent years.   
Emissions from buildings (that is, heating) has barely dropped  in 30 years  - energy efficiency of the 
UK’s housing stock is generally poor, and improving  household energy efficiency (whilst being vital, 
and bringing dramatically lower energy bills to householders) will be expensive  and disruptive , 
requiring the replacement of gas boilers by high efficiency electric heating, and increasing insulation.   
National level  progress to date leaves no room for complacency.  As the Committee on Climate 
Change’s 2020 recent annual report to Parliament16 makes clear, whilst the UK has met it’s carbon 
budgets to date, it is projected to miss future ones, and that’s before taking a ccount of the revision 
to the legally binding target of net zero emissions , which used to be -80%, and is now -100% by 2050  
(from a 1990 baseline) .  
The country, just like businesses, individuals and public sector bodies like Cotswold District Council, 
now  faces the really hard work .  Many of the easy wins (like swapping coal generation for gas) have 
been done , and the legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 requires a much steeper fall 
in emissions per year from now onwards, than we have achie ved to date . 
For individuals and organisations at local level, it is true that much of the heavy  lifting  in building low 
carbon infrastructure  - like installing offshore wind turbines or building nuclear power stations or 
manufacturing electric vehicles for example  - is being done by others .  However we won’t achieve 
the zero carbon future we need unless individuals and organisations play a n active role in spending 
their own money and adapting their own behaviours to enable the big infrastructure changes to  take 
effect.  
7.2 Cotswold district emissions  
7.2.1 Territorial (production) emissions  
The most recent BEIS data (2018) for Cotswold District shows net emissions of approximately17 605 
ktCO 2e, equating to around 6.8 tCO 2e per resident, and 0.52ktCO 2e/km2 of la nd area  (Table 1: 
District -wide emissions by source, incl LULUCF, ktCO 2eTable 1). This comprises approximately18 
650ktCO 2e arising directly from fuels bu rned and electricity consumed (generated mainly out of the 
district ), less an estimate of carbon removed from the atmosphere - that is, sequestered (or stored) 
in plants and soils in the district ( approximately  negative 44.5ktCO 2e), termed LULUCF (land use , land 
use change and forestry) emissions.

Table 1: District -wide emissions by source, incl LULUCF, ktCO 2e 
For context, Cotswold District annual CO 2 emissions are equivalent to the emissions from burning 
about 560 Cirencester lei sure centre -sized swimming pools of diesel each year, or driving an average 
family car about 2.7 billion miles.  At 18% of the county’s total, Cotswold’s emissions are the third 
largest of the six districts ( Figure 6).

 For emissions exclu ding LULUCF, slightly less than a third of emissions arise from industry, commerce 
(offices, shops and venues) and farming.  One quarter comes from households, and just shy of half 
comes from road transport ( Figure 7). 
 
Figure 7: Proportional emissions from all sources, Cotswold District, excl LULUCF  
Not included in ( Figure 7) is the effect of carbon being emitted from or taken up by land. The balance 
between carbon emitted and sequestered through land use is an estimate only, and only around 6% 
of the total, but nonetheless is important  (Figure 8Figure 8).   
Increasingly, rural and farming parts of the country will need to find more ways to reduce  carbon 
emissions from land, and increase the amount of carbon sequestered into  standing b iomass and 
soils.  Government’s estimate of land -based carbon balance for the Cotswolds shows that carbon is 
emitted from cropland and settlements, but  this is more t han offset by the amount sequestered into 
forest , grassland  and well managed soils , leaving a net negative emission figure (that is, sequestered 
carbon) of 44.5ktCO 2.  
 
 
 
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  29 
  
 
The proportions of different emissions make clear  the challenge for emissions reduction in the 
District.  Electricity emissions will continue to fall as the grid decarbonises, and whilst the District 
should  be able to contribute significantly towards this by building renewable generation, the really 
tough nuts to crack are road transport and fuels for heating.   Burning these fossil fuel s emit s over 
500,000 tonnes of CO 2e per year, or around 85% of the District’s total.  
The history of greenhouse gas  emissions in the Dis trict over the last thirteen years (Figure 9) shows 
how hard it is to reduce thes e direct fossil fuel emissions .  Whilst electricity emissions have fallen 
steadily, emis sions from burning gas, vehicle and other fuels is virtually unchanged.   
The same challenge faces the whole country, but as a rural district it is particularly acute.  Rural 
areas do not (currently ) benefit from the frequency of public transport  and the d ensity of space that 
cities do.  Many properties are still heated by oil, and most residents outside of our main towns rely 
on private cars.  Ours is a large district with a low population density, so distances travelled tend to 
be larger.  Many of the Dis trict’s older stone properties, whilst having  the benefit of remaining 
significantly cooler during heatwaves than newer properties, can nonetheless be ‘hard to heat and 
hard to treat’ (that is, difficult to improve the energy efficiency of) .

7.2.2 Consumption emissions  
Government  statistics for  greenhouse gas  emissions from Cotswold district reported above relate 
only to emissions that arise directly from activity in the district (such as burning fossil fuels in 
buildings and vehicles), and emissions from electricity consumed in the district, but mainly 
generated elsewhere.   These are termed ‘production emissions’, since they arise from activity taking 
place within the territory . 
However for a fuller understanding we of how we as individual citizens, businesses and the public 
sector affect the climate crisis, we must look also at our ‘consumption emissions’ – that is, emissions 
related to the supply of goods and services we  buy, including those imported from abroad . 
Accurate data for consumption emissions is not readily available for Cotswold district.  However we 
can draw some high level conclusions  from UK -wide data .  
The first point to note is that, whilst UK emissions fr om territorial activity (‘production emissions’) 
have fallen by over 40% in the period from 1990 to 2018, emissions due to the goods and services 
Figure 9: Time series analysis of district emissions   
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  31 
 we buy and consume have fallen much less – by just 16% to the year 2017 ( Figure 10Figure 10)19.  
This discrepancy is because, whilst the UK has markedly reduced emissions from the power sector, 
we have also reduced the amount of indigenous manufacturing, with a much greater proportion  of 
the goods we consume now made overseas, often in parts of the world with high emissions from the 
manufacturing and power sectors.  
 
 
 
At an individual lev el, the average greenhouse gas  emissions per person in the UK is around 9 tonnes 
CO 2e per year  (Figure 11Figure 11)20.  No data exists for what the emissions footprint is of an average 
resident of Cotswold district.  However the factors that affect individuals’ and households’ emissions 
will include wealth, size of property, age of property, amount of air travel, heating system, diet and 
many others.  
For the average UK resident, about half our emissions come from the energy we consume directly 
(vehicles, home heating etc) and half from the things we buy .  The conclusion is that the big wins 
come from slashing emissions from heating buildings and driving vehicles, followed closely by our 
food choices.

Emissions due to the buildings a nd operations of the Council, for the most recent year (2019/20) 
amount to some  2,746 tonnes CO 2e, or around 0.4% of the emissions of the district as a whole  (Table

 Data has been collected according to the principles of materiality and practicality , and audited by an 
independent external body .  No organisational emissions  data exercise is ever complete or  accurate, 
but princip al sources of data have been collected which enable a fairly complete picture, and enable 
year -on-year comparisons.  
The largest contributor by emission source (51%) is liquid fuels (diesel, petrol), principally for the 
waste collectio n fleet, and the second largest (25%) is gas consumption to heat Council buildings and 
leisure buildings.   
Looking at current emissions in the context of the last nine years for which good data has been 
collected shows good progress by the council to date , with emissions falling from around 4,000 
tonnes CO 2e in 2010 to 2,746 today.  
The key omission from data to date has been staff commuting.  Setting up systems to enable staff 
commuting to be measured will take time, require additional data input by staff,  and will never be 
precise.  However this is an important data set to capture, since incentives and changes of habit are 
likely to deliver significant carbon savings.  
One result of the Covid -19 crisis has been much more home -working and much less commuting .  
Publica’s agile working strategy means that staff commuting emissions will continue to be lower 
than before, but whilst commonsense suggests home working saves carbon, there are many factors 
and assumptions at play.  Estimates by the International Energy Agency21 using European averages 
suggest that workers who avoid a commute by car for four miles or more may save carbon, whereas 
those who drive less far, or who take public transport or active travel may emit more carbon by 
working from home.  True figures will be very hard to calculate.

 9 Emission reduction t argets  
Many Local Authorities with a climate strategy have adopted a target for emissions reduction for 
their  entire  administrative area, and all have adopted a target for reduction of emissions from the 
council’s own estate and operations.  
9.1 A district -wide target  
Government estimates of district -wide emissions are available up to 2018.  As discussed elsewhere, 
emissions  from electricity consumption are falling fast, as the grid decarbonises (as more renewable 
electricity generation is brought on).   
Whilst the District must play the fullest part it can in hosting new renewable energy generation, the 
more  difficult task i s reducing emissions from road transport and fossil fuels for heating.  Since the 
grid will continue to decarbonise, district -wide target setting must also address the most difficult 
emission categories – ie, all those excluding electricity.  
9.1.1 Context settin g 
As context for the target setting research, and to illustrate the scale of th e challenge, ( Figure 13) sets 
out alternative targets and pathways for comparison.  
The ‘ze ro by 2050 straight line’ target simply mirrors the net zero target now enshrined in UK law 
through the Climate Change Act 2008.  As the UNFCCC points out, national level commitments to 
date are insufficient to reach the Paris target of limiting global hea ting to 1.5degC.  
The Science -based targets initiative (SBTI)22 is a voluntary commitment increasingly being made by 
large corporate s, in which they adopt targets based on achieving either the most ambitious Paris 
target of 1.5degC (1.5C), or else the fall -back Paris target of ‘well below 2degC’ (WB2C).  Whilst 
mainly used by large private sector firms, it is useful to show the equivalent reduction paths for the 
District.  The 1.5C pathway is steeper (more challenging) than the ‘zero by 2050 straight line’ 
pathway, but the WB2C pathway is shallower.  
For comparison the diagram also shows the equivalent reduction pathway adopted by the Council 
relating to its corporate emissions.  This is the most challenging pathway of any illustrated, which is 
consistent with the leadership role the Council wishes to fulfil.  
                                                           
22 http s://sciencebasedtargets.org/sbt_events/net -zero -targets -in-the-corporate -sector -option -1/  
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  36 
  
Figure 13: Target setting options for district -wide emissions excluding electricity  
The United Nations Environment Programme23 (UNEP)’s 2019 ‘annual gap report’ spells out how far 
national commitments to date will deliver the Paris agreement.  It makes for sobering reading.  
UNEP estimates that if existing national commitments are adhered to (a big assumption  in itself ), it 
would lead to catastrophic global heating of over 3degC.  U NEP states that an emissions reduction of 
7.6% per year is now required, for the decade 2020 -2030, in order to keep within the Paris limit.  
This reduction pathway, applied to the distri ct, is slightly less steep than the target adopted by the 
Council for its corporate emissions.  
What is certain is that leaving the attempted achievement of a target to close to the target date will 
not work.  Emissions must be avoided as early as possible in the decade since the heat trapping 
gases build up in the atmosphere , and leaving action to later increases the cost and disruption of 
that action . 
9.1.2 Identifying  and communicating  a district -wide target  
We will conduct cost-effective research to determine a stretching district -wide emissions reduction 
target based on the lev el of reduction necessary to contribute fully to meeting the Paris Climate 
Accord, and which also seeks a fair allocation of effort and reward across all communities.   The 
target setting research will identify the actions that would need to be taken by sta keholders across 
the district, and the emissions reduction pathway that those actions could deliver .

paris -target -un-report  
 
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  37 
 This will inevitably be an immensely challenging target , in keeping with the scale of the climate 
emergency .  The Council will work with key large emitting stakeholders in the district, as well as 
engag ing with residents, and use the target to raise awareness, focus debate, increase commitment 
and spur the wider adoption of the target and development of joint projects that collectively can 
deliver large emission reductions.  
In this way the target is above all else a communication tool, but one which is based in science and 
highlights the lack of international and national progress to date, and the need for all countries, 
organisations and indivi duals urgently to reduce emissions.   
9.2 The Council’s operational target  
The target for CDC’s own estate and operations forms part of the Climate Emergency Declaration 
approved unanimously by the Council in July 2019 : to “Make the Council’s own activ ities net -zero 
carbon as soon as possible, aiming for an 80% reduction against a 1990 baseline by 2030, and a 
100% reduction by 2045, with no reliance on offsetting or the trading of carbon credits” . 
The 1990 baseline year is used  because it mirrors the baseline used  in the Climate Change Act 2008.  
The Council  has recorded it s own emiss ions data only since 2010, but bac k-casting from 2010 data, 
using changes in national level emissions as a proxy, suggests Council emissions may ha ve been at 
around 4,500 tonnes CO 2e in the baseline year ( Figure 14).  
 
 
Figure 14: CDC historic and target net emissions   
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  38 
 Projecting forwar d from the baseline year shows the scale of the Council’s commitment, aiming to 
reach around a two thirds reduction from present level by 2030, and zero net emissions by 2045.   
The Council’s annual emissions are reported consistently, and it will be straig htforward to report 
progress towards this very challenging target.

 10 The Council’s scope to act and priority action 
areas  
Whilst the Council has statutory responsibility for waste collection, local planning policy and other 
matters, it has neither the powers nor resources to directly drive down district -level emissions which 
are the responsibility of individuals and organisations.  However the Council has an important 
leadership role, networks and relationships which can be used to assist an d influence key 
stakeholders.  
10.1 Levers of influence  
A simple analysis of the levers of infl uence available to the Council ( Figure 15) illustrates the 
difference between control and effect.  There are activities over which the Council has direct control 
(such as decisions relating to assets and property owned and operated by the Council), but which 
contribute only a small amount to the whole district’s emissions reduction.   In contrast there are 
activities that the Council has limited influence and no control over, but which if implemented would 
have the largest effect on the whole district’s emissions.  
 
Figure 15: Levers of influence  
 
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  40 
 10.1.1  Direct contro l 
Actions in this category are aimed at achieving CDC’s stated target of a minimum of two thirds 
reduction in net emissions from 2020 to 2030, reaching net zero by 2045.   Illustrative action areas 
include waste fleet decarbonisation through new technology,  delivering affordable and net zero 
carbon housing, widening carbon data capture, improving staff climate literacy, taking action at 
Trinity Road, and undertaking energy projects at commercial and non -commercial sites.  
10.1.2  Indirect control  
Actions in this cate gory relate to projects, services etc procured or strongly influenced by the 
Council, including policies and incentives that encourage employees to act in a low -carbon way.  
Actions will contribute less directly to CDC’s emissions target, affecting mainly ‘scope 3’ emissions, 
and will also impact district -wide emissions to some extent.  Illustrative action areas include 
developing a sustainable procurement policy with climate considerations at its heart, putting climate 
considerations into key policy areas such as economic development and the Council’s corporate 
plan, procuring 100% place -based renewable electricity, reducing carbon from staff home working 
and commuting, and co -investing in capital projects.  
10.1.3  Place shaping   
Place making relate s to the Council ’s responsibility for Local Plan policies, but also partnerships 
where the Council is a key influencer or stakeholder.  Illustrative action areas the review of the Local 
Plan to make it green to the core, creation of a renewable energy strategy for the dis trict for 
incorporation into the Local Plan, and development of a sustainable travel strategy and action plan 
for the district.   
10.1.4  Enabling  
Enabling actions are those where the Council’s role is  proactive, help ing others to take action by 
initiating new ideas, supporting new projects, promoting initiatives and social norming – helping to 
make low carbon business decisions and lifestyle choices easy and automatic.   Illustrative action 
areas include promoting electri c vehicle uptake, supporting whole -house energy retrofit, supporting 
renewable energy tariff switching and neighbourhood solar PV schemes, helping to build a 
community owned renewable energy co -operative, and initiating multi -stakeholder energy schemes.  
10.1.5  Engaging  
Engagement actions aim to achieve a closer dialogue with citizens and organisations throughout the 
district on the topic of the climate emergency, and our responses to it.  Good engagement is 
particularly important in the context of the need for rap id and profound change to respond to what, 
for many, is still an invisible or hypothetical threat.   
A key challenge is in accessing all audiences, and opening the engagement up beyond those who are 
already well aware of the climate crisis.  Everyone has t heir own world view and experiences, and  
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  41 
 the impact of climate change will be felt differently by everyone.  Good engagement should help us  
listen to and understand the widest possible range of personal experiences, bring people together 
round this agenda , and help make the Council’s communications and decisions better as a result.  
The foundation of successful engagement is a communications strategy.  There are great examples 
of local authorities that have spent considerable sums on innovative ways of enga ging the public in 
the climate topic, but it may not be appropriate for Cotswold to devote such significant resources in 
this way.  
Nonetheless, meaningful and sustained engagement is essential to capture ideas, understand 
individuals’ priorities, and build  the public mandate to take increasingly vigorous and innovative 
action on the climate emergency.  
Illustrative action areas include supporting citizen -led activities like Green Open Homes, developing 
a climate change communications strategy, building on e xisting good relationships with key 
organisations in the district, identifying a district -wide carbon target, establishing a climate panel 
and working with Town and Parish Councils.  
10.2 Illustrative projects  and actions

influe nce and scope to act - direct control, indirect control, place shaping, enabling and engaging .

 12 Appendix  2: Links to external support  
There are a number o f county, regional and national level initiatives, policies and support structures 
which are relevant to this strategy, and may be drawn on.  
Some 70% of UK local authorities have declared a Climate Emergency  to date36.  Several Local 
Authority initiatives support councils to take action on the climate.  Cotswold District Council is a 
founder member of the Countryside Climate Network37, an initiative by the UK100 group of council 
leaders ambitious to make a difference on t he climate agenda.  
The LGA is developing support and coordination for LAs to improve efficiency and consistency in 
setting strategy and policy, and sharing ideas and innovation.  The LGA is actively canvassing views 
from LAs on what kind of support would be the most beneficial, and new products and services are 
likely to come forward in due course.  
The South West Energy Hub, hosted by West of England Combined Authority and fully funded by 
BEIS, is an information and expertise centre for low carbon transfor mation in energy generation and 
use, focused on local energy initiatives.  In Gloucestershire the partner is Gfirst LEP.  Many of the SW 
Energy Hub’s strategic priorities align well with CDC’s objectives, and we are already in discussion 
with the Energy Hu b about possible support to initiatives in the Cotswolds.  Support is available from 
the Energy Hub for project development up to procurement stage . 
Gloucestershire County Council’s Climate Emergency Strategy 2019/20 to 2024/25 is consistent with 
this strategy.   
Gfirst LEP’s draft Local Industrial Strategy38 (2019) states the aim for the County to reduce carbon 
emissions to net zero by 2050 , with aspirations to go further and faste r.  Whilst the draft strategy is 
not wholly focused on climate change, it does state the ambition to make Gloucestershire the 
greenest place to live and work in England, and the first place in the world to create a healthy 
circular economy.

 13 Appendix 3: Illustrative projects and actions  
Priority action areas are broken into  the Council’s leverage areas – direct control, indirect control, 
place shaping, enabling and engaging.  
The projects and actions listed here are illustrative only, and specific project plans will be brought 
forward through a separate report.  
13.1 Indicative d irect control  action areas  
13.1.1  Waste fleet  
This is a very hard nut to crack.  The Cotswold district covers 450 square miles, with a population of 
about 90,000.  One of CDC’s statutory duties is the collection (although not disposal) of domestic 
waste. Electric vehicles to collect household waste are at an early stage of development, but at 
present are around three times more expensive and only work in high density environments where 
routes are short.   
Innovation is happening at a fast pace, but it is not yet cl ear what winning technology will emerge 
for the replacement of heavy, medium - to long -distance diesel vehicles like refuse trucks.  Rural 
districts like the Cotswolds therefore present a big challenge to emissions reduction in waste fleets.  
The Council wi ll work actively with the waste collection contractor Ubico (part -owned by CDC) to 
continue to explore options initially for incremental emission improvements, and as soon as 
possible, more radical and complete solutions.   
Cotswold district is an importan t exemplar for other rural districts.  Our per km2 emissions are the 
lowest of all Gloucestershire districts, reflecting our low population density, and the distance our 
waste collection lorries have to travel.  Cotswold therefore represents a valuable opp ortunity to pilot 
solutions as soon as they become viable.  
13.1.2  Affordable housing  
Delivering genuinely affordable housing is one of the Council’s high priorities, along with the 
commitment to ensuring that all new CDC public buildings, and all residential and commercial 
developments on CDC disposed land, will be carbon neutral throughout their entire lifespan .   
Affordability needs to encompass not just the cost to build or buy, but residents’ total lifetime 
running costs.  Low running costs can be delivered th rough high energy efficiency and zero carbon 
design, which will cost more to build than poorer specification homes.  Whilst national policy does 
not demand it, increasing numbers of homes are being built to net zero carbon standards, and the 
techniques and  technologies required to achieve this benchmark are evolving quickly and falling in 
cost, as the industry scales up its capacity.   
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  46 
 The Council will have limited opportunities for such development, but where possible, and in 
keeping with the aim of providin g leadership, will showcase developments to use as exemplars for 
other rural authorities.  
13.1.3  Data and carbon reporting  
Annual reporting of CDC emissions can be made more complete by increasing the data capture from 
some ‘scope 3’ categories, notably on staff commuting.  Presently staff commuting emissions are not 
captured, and we will look at efficient and effective ways of capturing this data.  
13.1.4  Staff knowledge, training, support and working practices  
Action is already being taken to develop and roll -out a pro gramme of information and training which 
will bring all staff up to a level of understanding of the science of climate change, the risks it brings, 
the means of reducing emissions, and the role of the council.  Excellent examples exist of training 
programm es that can be replicated at CDC.  The challenge is to bring climate literacy up to the level 
of organisational commitment and universal coverage that we see in, for example, health and safety 
or safeguarding.  
There are existing incentives for staff to buy  bikes and electric cars, and these can be promoted 
more widely.  
The Council already encourages car sharing and planning meetings to minimise travel.  There are 
good example policies developed by national agencies and adopted by other public sector bodies 
that can be borrowed to enhance our ‘grey fleet’ (private car use) policy to ensure that we are 
minimising emissions from travel round the district.  
Publica’s  agile working strategy, developed in the light of the Covid -19 working from home 
requirement, will deliver valuable carbon savings from avoided commuting39. 
13.1.5  Trinity Road  
Gas and electricity consumption at Trinity Road are the largest emitters within the council’s direct 
control (excluding waste fleet and leisure centres).  Good work has been done in recent years to 
improve energy efficiency through eg controls and lighting  upgrades, and some opportunity exists 
for additional small scale projects to improve energy efficiency with a reasonable payback period,  
but now significant further progress can only be made with more fundamental changes and 
investments.  
Turning Trinity Road into a true zero carbon office space is, just, technically feasible, but would be 
enormously expensive and disruptive, given the intrinsic structure and energy performance of the 
Victorian era property.

how -much   
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  47 
 The Covid -19 crisis has introduced very signific ant short -term uncertainty on how to further tackle 
emissions at Trinity Road.  Staff have largely worked from home during the crisis, reducing emissions 
from Council buildings.  Publica’s agile working strategy will further reduce office occupancy over th e 
longer term.  An assessment has shown that a Trinity Road solar PV array of around 140kWp is 
feasible, but cannot be taken forward without more certainty about the medium and long term plan 
for future use of the building.  
13.1.6  Energy projects at commercial an d non -commercial sites  
There may be opportunities for refurbishment of energy systems (eg boilers, lighting, controls, 
certain fabric measures) on some of the commercially -let CDC properties, irrespective of the terms 
of the leases.  In the case of fully -repairing leases where the lessee has responsibility for the 
building’s E nergy Performance Certificate  and for decisions on upgrading energy systems, it may be 
possible to take a coordinated approach to investing in energy performance improvement which 
bene fits both CDC and the tenant.  
Achieving net zero across the commercial estate will demand both a deep fabric -first refurbishment 
of the properties, to maximise thermal efficiency and make the property technically suitable for the 
installation of highly eff icient electric heat pump heating.  For the end result to be net zero carbon 
will require the tenant to purchase electricity from a guaranteed zero -carbon source.  Changes will 
require partnership working with the tenant to achieve cost sharing.  
If individ ual commercial properties prove impossible to bring up to net zero carbon standards, CDC 
could consider disposal, with the aim of purchasing or building an alternative building asset with a 
NZC performance, capable of yielding the same rental income.  
There  may be minor solar PV opportunities at other council -owned sites, for example storage 
depots, or containerised electricity storage at (eg) Trinity Rd (which has its own feeder substation).  
Note that storage is unlikely to be viable as a stand -alone proje ct, but could become feasible if 
combined with other interventions.  Small scale PV installations on (eg) depots, particularly where 
there is low site demand, are unlikely to be cost -effective unless power can be provided to an 
adjacent offtaker on commerc ial terms.  
13.1.7  Major developments and investment projects  
The Council has adopted a motion  (Motion 9  of 2019/20)40 committing itself to ensuring that all new 
CDC public buildings, and all residential and commercial developments on CDC disposed land, will be 
carbon neutral throughout their entire lifespan (with Gloucestershire -based carbon offsetting as 
required).  
This commitment binds the Council for developments it takes forward, and will influence any 
investment or co -investment opportunities that come forward .

Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  48 
 The Council will seek commercial investment and co -investment opportunities, ideally within the 
district, for projects such as renewable generation that deliver the low carbon objective , whilst also 
providing a suitable risk -reward balance.  
13.1.8  Electric veh icles  
The Council is developing an electric vehicle strategy that encompasses electric vehicle  charging 
infrastructure for Council premises and public carparks, recognising that accelerating this 
fundamental technology shift will be one of the fastest ways  to decarbonise transport.  
13.1.9  Leisure centres  
Cirencester leisure centre already has good energy efficiency, but a planned survey is likely to show 
that some further improvement is possible, albeit at a higher cost since many of the ‘easy wins’ have 
already b een taken.  An initial assessment has shown the potential for around 300kWp PV 
generation on the Cirencester leisure centre and around 70kWp at Bourton.  
A half hourly electricity consumption analysis at Cirencester shows that sizing a PV array to supply 
only on -site instantaneous consumption limits the installation to around 120 -150kWp in order to 
maximise economic return.  However for both Cirencester and Bourton it may be possible to 
increase the size of the installation and sustain or enhance the returns  through collaboration with 
nearby electricity consumers, battery storage, electric vehicle  charging and other initiatives.  
Complex multi -component and multi -party projects of this kind require some certainty over the long 
term power demand, and this needs  to be evaluated in the context of emerging from the Covid -19 
crisis.  
13.2 Indicative i ndirect control  action areas  
13.2.1  Sustainable procurement, commissioning  
The Climate Emergency Declaration contains the commitment to require all suppliers to the Council 
to decla re the carbon intensity of the goods or services, and for the Council to incorporate this as a 
decision factor.  Procurement policies will be updated to incorporate this requirement.  
13.2.2  Renewable electricity procurement  
The Council’s current electricity suppl y is 100% renewable, as evidenced by certificates linked to 
renewable generation, but not evidenced by direct contracts with generators.  From a corporate 
carbon reporting viewpoint, and drawing on established best practice, this does not count as 
‘locatio n based’ 100% green electricity.  Purchasing electricity based on contracts with generators, 
and linking the supply to the real -time renewable generation, does permit the Council to claim zero 
carbon status for the electricity, and this will be explored at  the next available contract break point.    
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  49 
 13.2.3  Staff commuting and home working  
The Council’s carbon data gathering will be extended to capture commuting emissions, and the data 
used to help inform staff of the cost and carbon saving opportunity of avoiding th ese emissions by 
moving to active travel and taking advantage of incentives for electric vehicle  ownership.  
As Publica’s agile working policy becomes embedded, the Council will provide advice to employees 
on how to save energy and carbon from home working,  particularly in the winter where home 
heating emissions will rise.  
13.2.4  Co-investment in capital projects  
The Council will seek opportunities to co -invest in renewable energy and other carbon -reducing 
projects which meet a range of risk and return criteria.  Where the Council is a junior party in a 
multi -party investment, we will use our influence to ensure the biggest carbon benefit is delivered, 
ideally alongside other Council priorities.  
13.3 Indicative place shaping action areas  
13.3.1  Transport  
The Council is commit ted to producing a district -wide sustainable transport strategy, which will seek 
to deliver multiple benefits not just in carbon reduction but in increasing active travel, improving 
health and air quality, and introducing new ways for Cotswold residents to  access services.  
13.3.2  Renewable energy strategy  
Whilst the district has the emissions  disadvantage of a large area and dispersed, low density 
settlements, its land area can be an emissions advantage if land is used in ways that protect and 
increase carbon stor ed in soils and standing biomass, and generates sustainable energy.  
The Council is commissioning consultants to produce a renewable energy strategy that will be 
incorporated into the revision to the Local Plan.  The strategy will take account of all oppor tunities 
and constraints ( such as landscape constraints in the AONB), and  propose ways to maximise 
renewable generation in the district, consistent with those constraints and with the declaration of a 
climate emergency.   
13.3.3  Economic development  
The Council’s  economic development strategy and plans will incorporate climate change to ensure 
consistency between the objectives.  
  
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  50 
 13.3.4  Local plan review  
The Council has begun its review of the Local Plan, consistent with the Council’s priority to make the 
Local Plan ‘gre en to the core’.  The renewable energy strategy is a key part of this, but all other 
aspects of the Local Plan policies, particularly relating to sustainability criteria for housing and 
infrastructure developments, will be examined through the lens of the climate emergency.  
13.4 Indicative e nabling  action areas  
13.4.1  Promoting and supporting electric vehicle use  
The largest source of emissions in the district is from road transport, much of it by people living 
outside the district but travelling through.  This is the hardest nut to crack, since CDC’s control and 
influence is minimal.  Nonetheless CDC can play a valuable role in promotion and facilitation of 
residents making the move to electric vehicles through a district -wide electric vehicle  strategy which 
works with other parties to rapidly install EVCP infrastructure, and promote the use of EVs.  
CDC has an opportunity to link car park charging to vehicle emissions, as has been successfully done 
in some London boroughs.   
A growing number of  initiatives and options are available for towns and neighbourhoods to access 
low carbon technology, and many more will come forward during the decade.  One current example 
is CoCars – a not -for-profit social enterprise car club based in Exeter that rents electric cars by the 
hour.  Such innovations can make zero carbon technology available to people who can’t afford to 
join the electric vehicle  revolution by owning their own vehicle.  
Promotion and support of citizens moving to electric vehicle use will be integrated into the intended 
district -wide sustainable transport strategy and plans.  
13.4.2  Supporting whole house energy retrofit  
Retrofitting existing housing stock to bring it up to a near -net zero carbon standard is a key 
requirement for the District.  Govern ment has announced grants to support this, and the Council can 
proactively identify suitable low carbon interventions that would benefit Cotswold residents, and 
promote the grants scheme.  
CDC may be able to take a role in providing due diligence, risk redu ction and confidence building for 
early adopter owner occupiers by working with established suppliers to bring a housing retrofit 
solution (ie, contractor due diligence, objective evaluation of needs, contracting platform, etc) to the 
District.  It may be possible to coordinate this with social housing providers to help scale faster, 
improve efficiency and reduce costs.   
Such retrofit works will normally entail fabric improvement (insulation, airtightness) coupled to 
ventilation, heating system and control s.  The main candidate technology for zero carbon domestic 
heating is air source heatpumps.   
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  51 
 A key consideration for the District is the control of any retrofit works that affect the external 
appearance of buildings.  Specific (more expensive) solutions wi ll be required for period or historic 
houses.  In order to maximise the employment benefits for the District CDC could help coordinate 
links between local colleges and existing contractors in the District, to promote apprenticeship 
schemes.  If retrofit is  done at scale it ought to create business opportunities for existing firms in the 
District.  
It may increase the effectiveness of the scheme if it has its own District -specific brand / identity, 
making messaging more effective.  It may be possible to work with established lenders to arrange a 
financing facility, in recognition of the established fact that owners of very high (energy) 
performance homes have a low mortgage default rate.  
The Council may be able to support homeowners to access government support for energy retrofit 
actions by quality assuring and signposting homeowners to sources of advice.  
13.4.3  Supporting renewable electricity switching  
It may be possible to roll out a bulk electricity tariff switching offer to residents, in conjunction with 
a carefully chosen partner.  To make an impact on carbon emissions the tariff(s) would have to be 
100% additional renewable supply.  The Council can undertake due diligence to determine compliant 
suppliers, and can furthermore promote tariffs that support c ommunity -owned renewable energy 
generation.  
Depending on their existing tariffs, some residents may be able to make a slight saving, but 100% 
genuine green tariffs are more expensive than those that compete solely on price.  In principle it 
may be possible  for CDC to recoup some costs through a customer acquisition fee, which could be 
used to fund  specific climate projects.  
13.4.4  Facilitating community -owned renewable energy  
Ensuring residents get involved in climate and nature protection, and inviting residents  to take a 
leadership role, will be vital to the long term objective of achieving a net zero carbon District.  A key 
plank of such a transition is likely to be community ownership of, and investment in, renewable 
energy and other carbon reduction solutions .  Research consistently shows that local people feel 
differently, and much more positively, about necessary renewable developments when they have a 
real say, and when they and their communities are in charge and directly benefit.  
Done well, community ener gy organisations can have a reach well beyond the initial investors.  Good 
examples to look to include Oxfordshire’s Low Carbon Hub, Bath and West Community Energy, and 
Plymouth Energy Community.  All three have close working relationships with councils.  
The Council may be able to take a proactive role in facilitating the creation of a new entity, perhaps 
Cotswold Community Energy Ltd, probably with an independent Community Benefit Society 
structure (a form of co -operative).  The Council could, in principle , then co -invest in schemes 
alongside community shareholders.   
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  52 
 13.4.5  Solar neighbourhoods  
Neighbourhood -wide PV bulk purchasing is well established.  Developing and promoting a scheme 
could be (depending on the route chosen) a (relatively) low effort action for C DC.  Households would 
contacted, with CDC branding, and invited to express interest in taking part in a reduced -cost solar 
installation scheme.  When sufficient have expressed interest, the chosen contractor arranges 
surveys, and a firm price is offered to  each household, without obligation.  Significant cost 
reductions can be achieved compared to the open market, and more importantly, residents can have 
much greater confidence in the product, installer, warranties etc, due to the due diligence 
undertaken b y CDC.  
This approach targets the able -to-pay segment, not fuel -poor residents.  It is a simple intervention, 
but CDC could work with the enabling company to brand the initiative and give it greater local 
relevance.  One potential aspect of this is to push in-roof installations, rather than on -roof 
installations.  The former are less visually intrusive, have more resistance to wind uplift, and may be 
more fitting for a District with high landscape value and pride in its historic built environment.  
CDC could take a leadership role, ensuring maximum local employment value by linking the scheme 
to local quality -assured contractors / installers.  It is relatively easy for CDC to implement (easy as in 
time consuming, but not complex and un -manageable), and has the  benefit of demonstrating early 
action.  CDC could lead a District -wide programme broken down by town and/or neighbourhood.  A 
clear offer to residents would guarantee on price, quality and energy yield.  It would be possible to 
link installations to advic e on complementary supply tariffs and hot water storage or battery storage, 
to maximise benefits.  Installations could be packaged up with domestic electric vehicle  charging 
installation, again to maximise PV benefit.   
13.4.6  Multi-stakeholder energy projects  
Energy projects may be possible, enabled by the Council’s ownership of land and buildings, which 
link together multiple buildings and their occupiers / owners, with a combination of PV generation, 
behind -the-meter supply, electric vehicle  charging, high effi ciency heat pump heating, energy and 
heat storage, and smart controls such as time of use tariffs and demand side management.  Such 
schemes could be viable at a number of town centre sites, but will require considerable innovation 
in commercial structures,  financing, legals and technology integration in order to succeed.  
The energy market and commercially available technologies are both fast -moving.  Bringing several 
complementary technologies together can achieve viability where isolated technology applica tions 
alone do not.  Larger scale projects can benefit from improved economics, however multi -site, multi -
stakeholder projects carry the additional burden of complexity, which increases project risk.  
We will explore opportunities for innovative schemes, ta king a cost -effective incremental route to 
exploring viability and building momentum.   
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  53 
 13.5 Indicative engagement action areas  
13.5.1  Supporting citizen led initiatives  
Examples of highly successful initiatives that have been rolled out at scale elsewhere include the 
Green Open Homes network (peer mentoring and encouragement of homeowners wanting to make 
energy improvements), domestic electric vehicle  chargepoint sharing platforms such as Chargie, and 
peer mentoring for new electric vehicle  drivers.  
13.5.2  Climate communicatio ns strategy  
The Council will develop a communications and engagement strategy, and integrate all actions into 
it.  It is likely to be beneficial to adopt a proven digital democracy platform to enable dialogue to 
take place, and this will be integrated into  the Council’s other consultation actions.  
13.5.3  Signposting information and resources  
The Council will develop climate communications through its web sites and social media, and 
signpost resources to guide citizens to the best quality information, to build conf idence and the 
commitment to act.  
13.5.4  Engaging key stakeholders  
The Council will develop further its engagement with key stakeholders in the district whose own 
actions and whose influence on others will have important climate change outcomes.  Such 
stakeholder s would include statutory and non -statutory bodies, pressure groups, landowners and 
developers, other authorities, and public sector and private sector organisations.  
13.5.5  District wide carbon reduction target  
The Council will undertake its own research and co mmission consultancy support if necessary, to 
establish a rational, evidence based but stretching district -wide carbon reduction target and 
pathways.  The target will be used in climate engagement work, as a means to open conversations 
and encourage greate r commitment to action.  The target can be used to show all stakeholders that 
the UK’s national target (net zero by 2050) is too little too late, measured against the scale and 
speed of change we need to achieve.  It will furthermore prompt challenging dis cussions about how 
to achieve fairness and the equitable distribution of the burdens and benefits of action.  
13.5.6  Climate panel  
The Declaration calls for the creation of a District -wide Climate Panel.  This idea will be developed in 
the context of an overarching engagement and communications strategy, with the potential to use a 
citizens’ panel as part of the oversight and governan ce of the Council’s climate strategy.  It is unlikely 
to be cost effective to develop a full   
 
Cotswold District Council Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -2030  54 
 13.5.7  Town and Parish Councils  
The Council will engage consistently with TCs and PCs, not least through climate action planning 
days.  TCs and PCs will be able to play an important role in convening local citizens, generating local 
ideas and understanding the place -specific needs of residents.
