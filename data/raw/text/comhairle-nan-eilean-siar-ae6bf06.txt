 1 Executive Summary 
In the previous Carbon Management Plan (CM Plan) pu blished in 2013, Comhairle nan 
Eilean Siar stated its aspiration to achieve a redu ction target of 20%, based on the 2009 
carbon footprint baseline, by 2015. A number of fac tors have made this a challenging target 
including: the complexity of the carbon management process; demands for new skills 
within, and time from, existing staff in the identi fication, planning, resourcing and tracking 
of carbon reduction projects/initiatives; a changin g legislative and policy framework, and 
the changing nature of estate and building use, as well as an increasing energy 
intensiveness of the building stock.   
These factors combined to suggest that a review and  revision of the original Carbon 
Management Plan, including reduction targets, would  help Comhairle nan Eilean Siar move 
forward constructively.   
This CM Plan sets out our ambitions for Comhairle n an Eilean Siar, and a roadmap for 
progress. Reducing carbon emissions is not just abo ut our commitment to the environment. 
The same processes we use to identify carbon emissi ons reduction will also identify and 
realise financial savings through improved efficien cy in the procurement and operation of 
our assets. The actions outlined within this Plan f orm part of our efficiency plan to reduce 
consumption and provide value for money. 
The 2016 carbon footprint was calculated to be 17,1 96 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 
(tCO 2e) and covered electricity, gas/LPG, gas oil consum ption, transport (fleet), water, 
wastewater consumption and waste.   
Comhairle nan Eilean Siar has therefore decided to reset its baseline to 2016 and target a 
9.87% reduction to its total annual carbon footprin t by the end of financial year 2023; this 
continues the aspiration of a 42% reduction but bas ed upon the 2009 footprint and to be 
delivered by 2023. The 2016 baseline this time incl udes staff travel via mileage claims and 
mileage derived from the use of fleet cars.  
 
 
 
 
 
Carbon saving projects are first identified, and th en approved for funding, once a business 
case has successfully been made.   
Savings in projects identified, but yet to be appro ved and funded are not included in graphs 
and charts throughout this report, future progress reports will include savings as projects 
are approved and fully funded. 
The following graphs overleaf details Comhairle nan  Eilean Siar’s 2016 baseline carbon 
footprint and related expenditure: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  By 2023, through the introduction of carbon saving p rojects Comhairle nan Eilean 
Siar will have reduced its carbon emissions by 9.87% on  a baseline of 2016. This 
equates to a figure of  15,499 tonnes CO 2e in 2023 Comhairle nan Eilean Siar’s Carbon Management Plan (CM Plan) 2017/2023

Reductions will be achieved through a range of proj ects including energy, fleet and 
awareness raising initiatives. The Comhairle will f und Carbon management projects through 
both capital and revenue funding. These funds will be made available on completion of a 
detailed business case for all separate projects.  
If all identifiable carbon saving projects were to be implemented, the potential project cost 
savings to the organisation are in the region of £271,040  over the period 2017 to 2023 .

 2 Foreword from the Project Sponsor 
 
The Outer Hebrides, in common with all Scotland, ar e equally exposed to the effects of 
climate change. The Comhairle will lead on programm es and projects to mitigate the impact 
on climate change through the use and development o f low carbon energy and management 
of consumption and waste. 
 
Partnership, leadership, corporate commitment and c ompetent management underpin the 
effort to exceed a reduction of fifty percent in ou r 2009 carbon emissions baseline. Public 
sector service development and sustainability will be framed in environmental limits to 
demonstrate our commitment to climate change. 
 
The Carbon Management Plan is a driver for change a cross all of the authorities operations 
and activities. Governance and performance measurem ent will be given a high priority to 
make sure that our reduction target of 1,697 tCo2e is achieved within the agreed time 
frame. Strategic developments in Asset, Estate, Fle et and Waste Management will make a 
significant contribution to reducing emissions. 
 
The opportunities in Carbon Management to reduce co sts and emission and achieve 
operational benefits are well understood. Comhairle  nan Eilean Siar is committed to 
resourcing the plan and proposal through available in-house and out-sourced means and 
solutions.

 3 Foreword from Resource Efficient Scotland 
 
On behalf of Zero Waste Scotland, which delivers th e Resource Efficient Scotland programme for the 
Scottish Government, I commend the commitment of th e Comhairle nan Eilean Siar for their ongoing aim 
of  improving resource efficiency throughout their operations. There are clear benefits of using fewer  
resources and reducing emissions to any organisatio ns and this plan details how the Council will reduc e 
their carbon footprint by 9.87% by 2023 based on a baseline year of 2016. 
 
The projects detailed in this Carbon Management Pla n will both improve the environmental performance 
of the organisation and lead to a reduction in oper ational carbon emissions. By implementing all of th ese 
projects, it is anticipated that cumulative CO2e sa vings of at least 1,697 tonnes by 2023  can be achieved 
not only reducing the adverse effect on the environ ment but realising valuable cost savings for the 
Comhairle.   
 
The Comhairle have identified that the key ways it will reduce its carbon emissions is by improving th e 
efficiency of their lighting, improving their heati ng and reducing the amount of water consumed. Zero 
Waste Scotland is pleased to have supported Comhair le nan Eilean Siar with the development of this pla n 
and we look forward to continuing to work with the Council to support the implementation of the 
planned resource efficiency measures over the comin g years. 
 
Zero Waste Scotland also looks forward to working w ith the Comhairle on potential low carbon heat 
projects and tackling food waste within the organis ation and its stakeholders.

 4 Introduction 
Background to the Organisation 
CnES is one of three distinct Islands authorities i n Scotland.  Its main offices are in 
Stornoway, Tarbert, Balivanich and Castlebay, provi ding services including education, social 
and community services, roads, economic development , planning, buildings standards, and 
waste management and other environmental services. 
 
The Comhairle owns, maintains and manages a large a sset portfolio. Their asset base 
comprises of the following; property, roads infrast ructure, marine infrastructure, waste 
management infrastructure, vehicles and plant, ICT and renewable technology, all of which 
are used to assist deliver the Comhairle’s services .   
 
The contribution of the Outer Hebrides to the proce ss of climate change is small, but the 
impact on the islands as a result of climate change  is considerable.  Increased sea levels 
and storm intensity will have a disproportionate im pact on the islands environment and how 
we live and work.  The current economic context cou pled with a finite amount of fuel from 
traditional sources means that organisations have m uch to gain in seeking to reduce their 
energy costs and carbon footprint.  
The Comhairle will give visible and positive leader ship towards a low carbon economy. A 
governance structure has been put in place during t he development of this plan, and will 
oversee its implementation and impact. In addition to this, the Comhairle will also engage 
with Community Planning Partners, particularly NHS Western Isles, to work together to 
become a ‘carbon positive Outer Hebrides’.  
CnES’s Performance on Carbon Management to date 
Although  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar  began their  Carbon Management Programme  in 2009,  
they have been implementing energy saving measures since the early 1990’s. With the 
organisation’s reporting obligations there is alrea dy a reasonably well established process 
for measuring and monitoring carbon emissions and p roject list to achieve carbon savings.  
The key issues facing the organisation comprise the  changes to the built estate, 
transportation fleet, staff/service users throughou t, as well as increasing energy consuming 
equipment and facilities, all of which will have si gnificant impacts on future carbon 
emissions.  CnES’s Carbon Management Team will cont inue to take measures to adapt the 
CM Plan to any potentially significant impacts on a chieving CM Plan targets. 
In the previous Carbon Management Plan published in  2013-15, the organisation set a 
reduction target of 20% based on a 2009 carbon foot print baseline of 26,831 tCO 2e; this 
equated to a target footprint of 21465 tCO 2e and an overall cumulative reduction of 5366 
tCO 2e across the 5 year period to 2015. The above targe t was exceeded with the final 
cumulative reduction being 45.31% or 12,158 Tco2e. The 2009 footprint included emissions 
from: electricity, gas and oil consumption; transpo rt; waste and water consumption.  
A number of factors have made this a challenging ta rget.  In common with their peers and 
many other public sector organisations at that time , the complexities associated with 
delivering a comprehensive carbon management progra mme were new and not fully 
understood. Despite the organisation’s good history  of implementing energy efficiency 
measures, the increasing demands on staff, associat ed with the identification, planning, 
resourcing and tracking of carbon reduction project s/initiatives, have meant that they were 
effectively developing new skill sets and increasin g their knowledge-base, whilst still 
continuing to perform existing duties.   
Furthermore, the changing legislative and policy fr amework has meant that the drive to 
meet the stated CM Plan carbon reduction target has  often been overshadowed. Finally, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar’s Carbon Management Plan (CM Plan) 2017/2023 
9 
 energy intensiveness within buildings is increasing , estate is changing and there is a 
constant drive to increase service delivery.   
These factors have combined to suggest that a revie w and revision of the original Carbon 
Management Plan, including targets, would help the organisation move forward 
constructively.

 5 Carbon Management Strategy  
Context and Drivers for Carbon Management 
The organisation faces a complex set of drivers whi ch set the context for carbon 
management. Crucially, the organisation recognises that these cannot and should not be 
viewed in isolation from each other or the principl e goal of continuously minimising its 
environmental impact whilst maximising its contribu tion to society and the economy. 
Ultimately, a strong performance with respect to ca rbon emission reduction should deliver 
financial benefits to CnES by mitigating the risks associated with e.g. increases in energy 
tariffs and levies such as the CRC EES.  
The following represent the key carbon drivers for Comhairle nan Eilean Siar: 
/square6 Scottish Government targets;  
/square6 UK & European targets; 
/square6 Climate of reducing financial allocations; 
/square6 Rising energy costs; 
/square6 Principle that investments in carbon reduction are generally associated with 
commensurate reductions in future expenditure; 
/square6 The need to eliminate waste of resources and to inc rease efficiency; 
/square6 The organisation’s own carbon management targets; 
/square6 Depletion of the world’s finite resources;  
/square6 It’s the right thing to do. 
 Legislative drivers for carbon management 
Over the past 20 years there have been many pieces of legislation enacted at an increasing 
rate in the UK and Scottish Parliaments which aim t o address the issue of climate change, 
carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions and sus tainability.  Many of these stem from 
European Union Directives which in turn were develo ped in order to meet the obligations of 
the Kyoto Protocol, adopted in December 1997 and en forced in 2005. Under Kyoto, ratifying 
countries agreed to commit to reductions in their c arbon emissions by, on average, 5.2% 
below 1990 levels by 2008-12.   
The Agreement was supported in the UK by the findin gs of the Stern Review 1 on the 
Economics of Climate Change, published in October 2 006, which provides compelling 
economic reasons to address climate change.  
The UK share of the collective Kyoto target assumed  by the European Union under the 
Protocol is a 12.5% reduction in emissions below 19 90 levels by 2012.  Subsequently the 
UK Climate Change Programme (launched in 2000) set a target of 20% reduction by 2010 
and 60% reduction by 2050.  The Climate Change (Sco tland) Act 2009 pledges to reduce 
Scotland’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 42% by  the year 2020 and by 80% by the 
year 2050. Scottish Ministers are also committed to  the promotion of renewable energy in 
Scotland. They set a target that 80% of the electri city generated in Scotland (as a

 proportion of gross consumption) should come from r enewable sources by 2020, with an 
interim target of 31% by 2011.  
The UK Government has placed an emphasis on the pub lic sector setting a leading example.  
Public sector leadership will be critical to the ac hievement of the Government’s climate 
change objectives. 
In addition to the EU’s Emissions Trading System (E U ETS), a number of legislative 
instruments such as the Climate Change Levy (CCL) a nd Carbon Reduction Commitment – 
Energy Efficiency Scheme (CRC EES) have been introd uced by the UK Government, 
designed to encourage organisations to reduce emiss ions. The CRC EES introduces carbon 
trading to energy intensive organisations not part of the EU ETS. The EU Energy 
Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) was trans posed into Scottish law in 2008 and has 
placed an obligation to evaluate energy usage, for inclusion in Energy Performance 
Certificates, to be displayed in all public buildin gs meeting certain criteria. The 2010 recast 
Directive also includes provisions, which include n early zero energy requirements, for new 
public buildings within 8 years or less, while Scot tish and UK Sustainable Construction 
strategies aim for zero energy buildings in the sam e time-frame. This, allied to recent 
changes in Buildings Regulations, will require the organisation to be proactive in terms of 
building design, construction and use.   
This present strategy document will aid the deliver y of key sustainability and estate 
management programmes in a carbon efficient and sus tainable manner. 
Some of the main legislative drivers affecting the organisation are set out in Appendix A; 
however, the list is not definitive. 
Other drivers for carbon management 
While reducing the financial and legal risks posed by various legislative requirements is a 
significant driver behind Comhairle nan Eilean Siar ’s carbon management programme there 
are other factors supporting the need for improving  energy efficiency and reducing carbon 
emissions.  
/square4 Cost saving : The case for carbon reduction is strengthened by current financial 
constraints requiring reduced operating costs whils t maintaining effective service 
delivery. This provides a strong incentive to cut r esource consumption to release this 
money for frontline services.  
/square4 Reputational benefit :  By delivery of sustained carbon reductions, Comh airle nan 
Eilean Siar will be viewed as an exemplar enhancing  the organisations broader 
sustainability credentials. 
/square4 Improved staff satisfaction :  Studies have identified a correlation between an  
organisation with strong environmental performance and high staff satisfaction.  
/square4 Improved engagement with key stakeholders :  Key stakeholders of Comhairle 
nan Eilean Siar, including the local community, are  increasingly focusing on 
sustainability. Comhairle nan Eilean Siar’s engagem ent and enhanced commitment 
will enhance the relationship with these stakeholde rs.

Carbon Footprint Baseline, Cost and Projections  
This section covers the establishment of the Comhai rle nan Eilean Siar’s carbon footprint, 
associated cost and ‘Business As Usual’ (BAU) cost projections.   
 
Graph 3 below shows the Business As Usual cost (blu e line) along with the future costs after 
all approved project savings have been made (red li ne). The Value At Stake (VAS) is the 
difference between these two lines and is £271,040 total cost savings over the plan period. 
 
Graph 3: showing ‘Business As Usual’ cost projections 
 
 
Scope and Boundaries of the Carbon Footprint 
The resources to be included in a carbon footprint are defined in relation to two boundaries, 
the organisational and the operational boundary.  
Definition of the boundaries is determined by the e xtent of the estate, goods and services 
over which Comhairle nan Eilean Siar has operationa l control, and the availability of good 
quality data.   
Organisational Boundary 
Organisation boundary: sets out which assets are to  be included in the footprint and is 
shown in the “category” column in Table 2 overleaf.    
Operational Boundary 
Operational boundary: essentially sets out the emis sion sources included in the footprint 
and are shown in the “emission sources” column in T able 2 overleaf.

Data Sources  
The data sources used in our CM Plan are based on r obust data provided by both internal 
and external partners. The main streams of data (co nsumption and costs) input are as 
follows:- 
i) Stationary Sources 
/square4 Electricity - TEAM Energy Management Syytem, histor ical AMR data, utility provider

/square4 Gas –  Historical data, utility provider billing. 
ii) Water

/square4 Staff mileage via fleet cars and independent busine ss mileage. 
Data was then collated and converted to a CO 2e tonnage equivalent using DEFRA factors for 
Company Reporting 
Conversion factors were taken for Scopes 1, 2 and 3  which relate to total direct emissions 
and are therefore in keeping with the methodology e mployed to determine previous Carbon 
footprints. As such, no ‘Well to Tank’ or ‘Outside Scope’ factors have been used. 
Carbon Footprint Baseline and Cost 
Comhairle nan Eilean Siar’s overall Carbon Footprin t for the Baseline year of 2016 was 
17,196 tonnes CO 2e. Comhairle nan Eilean Siar’s Carbon Management Plan (CM Plan) 2017/2023 
14 
 Graph 4 below shows that emissions from building an d street lights constitutes 57% of the 
2016 Carbon Footprint with Waste 35% and transport,  including staff mileage, and water 
representing the two smallest contributors.

Carbon Footprint Baseline and Cost 
Comhairle nan Eilean Siar’s overall cost of the Car bon Footprint for the Baseline year of 
2016 was £6,742,107. 
Graph 5 below shows that waste sources constitutes the largest cost of Carbon at 37%  of 
the overall Carbon cost budget. Transport and build ing sources contribute 30% each of the 
overall Carbon cost budget whilst water is responsi ble for 3% of the overall Carbon cost 
budget.

6:7 Business as Usual (BAU)  
Analysis of projected emissions and the expected im pact of BAU allow an evaluation of how 
the organisation’s carbon emissions will change ove r time in terms of tCO 2e emitted and 
cost. 
The results of the BAU analysis help to explain wha t is happening in the short and long 
term, what is happening to different parts of the f ootprint e.g. gas and electricity, and the 
current importance of the grid emission factor fore cast, including the level of uncertainty in 
relation to this beyond a certain point. 
Within the next 6 years, the organisation will pote ntially see changes in the 2017/2023 
period, with the associated partial or complete clo sure of a number of buildings; however 
some of these closures will fall into the CM Plan p eriod.  
Graph 6: showing 2016 BAU projections (cost) 
 
 
It can be seen that if consumption remained at 2015 /16 levels, then the associated costs 
would increase from £6,742,107 to £7,412,552 which equates to a 9.5% increase. 
This is the cost to Comhairle nan Eilean Siar if no  action is taken to invest in carbon saving 
measures.

 7 Carbon Management Projects 
Introduction 
In order to continue achieving emissions reductions  and avoiding financial exposure, 
Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is committed to identifyi ng and implementing carbon saving 
projects.   
Comhairle nan Eilean Siar recognises that successfu l attainment of its carbon reduction 
targets is contingent upon the following key elemen ts being in place:  
/square6 An organisational framework within the organisation  that is sufficiently robust to 
support the financing, delivery and monitoring of c arbon reduction projects. 
/square6 Clearly identified responsibility and accountabilit y for delivery against carbon reduction 
targets from the CM Plan outset.  
/square6 Identification of a realistic suite of carbon reduc tion projects across a range of areas 
relevant to the carbon footprint; this list must be  regularly reviewed and flexible to 
adapt to emerging needs and opportunities for fundi ng. 
/square6 A data collection and collation system that is inte grated sufficiently to inform both an 
annual progress update on the CM Plan and other Gov ernment and associated returns. 
Existing Projects 
The following are a sample of some of the initiativ es and projects which have already been 
completed or implemented since 2009. The carbon emi ssion savings achieved by these 
schemes will therefore have already contributed tow ards Comhairle nan Eilean Siar’s carbon 
reductions and corresponding savings will therefore  be included in the baseline carbon 
footprint for 2016.  
/square6 Loft Insulation; 
/square6 Renewable Installs; 
/square6 Door and Window Replacement. 
/square6 LED Lighting 
Planned Future Projects 
The projects identified below are a sample of those  that have been selected for 
implementation within the period 2016 to 2023 becau se they either generally provide the 
largest proportion of savings or were already plann ed for delivery as part of an ongoing 
programme of works. In relation to projects that ha ve had their associated potential carbon 
savings quantified, the sum predicted to be saved o ver the five year lifespan of the CM Plan 
amounts to 1,697 tCO 2e. 
Energy 
/square6 Lighting – Change to LED wherever suitable; 
/square6 Energy Management – Change of timings, increase of management controls; 
/square6 Renewable Technology – Installation of renewable te chnology where appropriate; 
/square6 Energy Efficiency – Targeted efficiency programmes;    Comhairle nan Eilean Siar’s Carbon Management Plan (CM Plan) 2017/2023 
17 
 /square6 Roll out of efficiency measures identified through RES surveys. 
Travel/Transport 
/square6 Review of staff travel arrangements, including pool  cars and electric vehicles; 
/square6 Ongoing review of Fleet and efficiency measure. 
Water 
/square6 Continued development of rain water harvesting at s elected properties; 
/square6 Roll out of water efficiency measures identified th rough Anglian Water surveys. 
In addition there are some “enabling” projects whic h while not directly leading to 
carbon savings, will “enable” further savings to be  achieved through subsequent 
outcomes/actions.  These will also require funding to be identified and allocated. 
Carbon savings will be achieved through a range of projects, which are as summarised 
in Appendix C. These cover energy, vehicle fuel and  water. For details of project 
funding, refer to the next section of this CM Plan.  Table 3 on the next page shows the 
capital cost and savings in future years. 
As explained in the executive summary only approved  and fully funded projects are 
included.

As explained in the executive summary only approved  and fully funded projects are included 
to date, however as more projects are approved the further reductions/savings can be 
reported.    
Target Setting  
Based on this analysis, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar t herefore commits to a target of 15,499 
tCO2e (9.87%) reduction on the 2016 carbon footprin t by 2023.   
 
 
   
 
Comhairle nan Eilean Siar would be likely to achiev e their emission reduction target if all 
approved projects were to be implemented in accorda nce with the intended timescales.   
There are proposed potential major estate changes t hat will impact on Comhairle nan Eilean 
Siar’s ability to achieve its carbon reduction targ et if, as is possible, these are brought 
forward to begin within the remit of this current C M Plan.  However, the strategy going 
forward is to develop a long term plan for Comhairl e nan Eilean Siar’s infrastructure, 
including heating, cooling, power and water, which focuses on a centralised approach; this 
is likely to result in rationalisation of estate wh ich will contribute to carbon emission 
reductions.   
Some carbon reduction projects within the Project L ist do not as yet have any carbon 
savings quantified; the majority of Comhairle nan E ilean Siar’s significant proposed projects 
do, however, have a quantified carbon reduction val ue, thus it is likely that these few 
projects remaining un-quantified will not significa ntly alter the outcomes of this CM Plan.   
Although Comhairle nan Eilean Siar has no control o ver utility, petrol, waste and water costs 
(limited through procurement choices), it can contr ol the amount of each used.  In order to 
reduce the financial burden, Comhairle nan Eilean S iar must reduce the amount of carbon 
emissions.  6,000,000  6,500,000  7,000,000  7,500,000 Cost £

 8 Management and Delivery of the Carbon Management Pl an  
Introduction 
In order to ensure that there is effective and ongo ing ownership of the Carbon Management 
Plan, it is important to have a fully defined gover nance structure.  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar 
will continue to adopt the following structure for management accountability. 
The Carbon Management Team 
The Carbon Management Team (CaMT) has responsibilit y for the operational direction and 
implementation of the CM Plan. Minutes/outcomes/rec ommendations of the CMT meetings 
are reported to the Asset Management Senior Officer  Working Group which provides 
feedback as appropriate. The Asset Management Senio r Officers Working Group 
subsequently reports to relevant Comhairle Committe es.  
The CaMT is convened by the Head of Assets & Infras tructure and meets regularly 
throughout the year. Meetings are scheduled to take  place prior to Asset Management 
Senior Officer Group (AMSOG) meetings to allow the Minutes/outcomes/recommendations 
to be disseminated at the AMSOG meetings.   
The composition of the CaMT is listed in the Table below and comprises a wide range of 
operational managers and senior technical staff who  are committed to driving the carbon 
reduction agenda forward. 
 
Name  Tit le  Department  
Anne M Murray  Strategy Officer  Development Services  
Calum Mackenzie  Head of Assets and Infrastructure  Technical Services  
Robert Maclennan  Asset Manager  Technical Services  
Robert Macleod  Services Engineer  Technical Services  
Ruaraidh Ferguson  Energy Efficiency Officer  Technical Services  
Fiona Rae (Clerk)  Operation Support Officer  Technical Services  
Amanda Mackenzie  Procurement Support Officer  Finance and Corporate Services  
 
The remit of the CaMT includes: 
/square6 developing policies for consideration by the Asset Management Senior Officers Group; 
/square6 ensuring effective communication of the organisatio n's policies to staff and students; 
/square6 monitoring the organisation's built environment per formance against its carbon 
management targets; and 
/square6 raising the profile of built environment carbon man agement in the community and 
promoting environmentally sustainable behaviour by staff and visitors. 
Operational Roles and Responsibilities 
Carbon Management Plan/Project Sponsor 
The Project Sponsor, Calum Mackenzie, Head of Asset s and Infrastructure, will champion 
the project and have ultimate responsibility for st rategic and operational direction and for 
agreeing budgets outside those already available to  CaMT. 
 Comhairle nan Eilean Siar’s Carbon Management Plan (CM Plan) 2017/2023 
23 
 Head of Assets & Infrastructure 
The Head of Assets & Infrastructure, Calum Mackenzi e will oversee the strategic 
implementation plan, have strategic input into its development, and review progress. 
Asset Manager  
The Asset Manager, Robert Maclennan, will coordinat e the implementation of the CM Plan 
and report on its progress to the Project Sponsor.  Responsibilities of the Asset Manager will 
also include the incorporation of progress into the  organisation’s Performance Management 
Software Tool (Interplan). 
Carbon Management Team  
The Carbon Management Team will be the key to commu nicating within the organisation 
and will represent all the services that operate bu ildings and vehicles, as well as officers 
with a cross-service remit, e.g. finance, ICT, prop erty investment and maintenance, estates 
management 
Resourcing and Ownership 
The Carbon Management Plan and carbon  saving target will be approved by the Comhairle’s 
Committee Structure, providing endorsement and a cl ear commitment at the highest level, 
reinforcing the need for action across the organisa tion. Committee approval will continue to 
provide long-term organisational momentum for embed ding the CM Plan and carbon savings 
across the organisation. This will primarily be del ivered through the governance structure 
for carbon management described in this Section.  
Key stakeholders at all levels of management will p rovide overall support for promoting a 
culture of carbon reduction throughout all building s.  
The CM Plan will be published online, and in pdf fo rmat, with a limited number of printed 
copies available for key stakeholders, thus leading  by example and saving paper and 
distribution costs. 
The Internal Delivery Model  
The key to success of this updated CM Plan is effec tive engagement with staff and the local 
communities. Everyone has a role to play in embeddi ng and delivering the CM Plan and 
collaborative working is essential to deliver the d esired carbon savings. 
The key stakeholders in the organisation who will c ontinue to shape and change culture and 
awareness are: 
/square6 Senior management; 
/square6 Heads of services and officers; 
/square6 All staff (key staff including technicians, adminis trators, grounds staff, janitors, 
cleaners, and security). 
Data Collection and Management 
Comhairle nan Eilean Siar’s present data collection  system affords reasonable data analyses 
using Energy Management Software. This is used to m onitor all energy costs and 
consumption from invoice data and a selected number  of building electricity sub meters. 
Performance data will be communicated to staff to r aise their awareness of the implications 
of their energy use to their department. This will be done regularly through energy reports. 
There are also plans to exploit existing facilities  within the proprietary Energy Management 
Software to disseminate this information through we b-based ‘dash boards’.  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar’s Carbon Management Plan (CM Plan) 2017/2023 
24 
 The CFPR tool is used to monitor and report on our energy and carbon use. It also provides 
ongoing information regarding carbon reduction proj ects and renewable energy generation. 
Communication and Training 
Reduction of the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar’s carbon  footprint is a key performance indicator 
for the organisation.   
The CaMT has developed a planned approach to raisin g carbon reduction awareness through 
the development of a robust communications and awar eness strategy.  
There are many avenues of communication available a nd these will be fully utilised in 
promoting the carbon reduction message to all staff  and visitors. Effective communication 
and engagement is the key to success.  It is recogn ised that substantial cultural change will 
take time to deliver. 
Initiatives for building awareness include: 
/square6 Email. 
/square6 Newsletters. 
The Carbon Management Team will regularly monitor p rogress and formally report to the 
AMSOG as described above ensuring that all major st akeholders are kept informed.

 9 Progress Reporting  
Yearly Updates to the Carbon Management Plan 
The Carbon Management Plan is viewed as a ‘live’ do cument and it is envisaged this will 
change on an annual basis as the organisation’s est ate changes and planning assumptions 
become reality. To ensure that the CM Plan remains ‘fit for purpose’ to deliver targeted 
carbon savings, the document will be reviewed on an  annual basis. This process will be 
overseen by the CMT and coordinated by the Asset Ma nager. 
Specifically, the following areas of the CM Plan wi ll be subject to annual review: 
/square6 Progress towards overall carbon reduction target in cluding CO 2e savings against target 
and quantifiable benefits; 
/square6 Progress with identified carbon reduction projects;  
/square6 Financial savings achieved as a result of carbon re duction projects; 
/square6 Costs of the programme; 
/square6 Wider benefits; 
/square6 Stakeholder engagement, and 
The review will be presented to the AMSOG through t he CMT.   
Data Collection and Management 
Data measuring the progress of the CM Plan will be collected regularly and presented to the 
various relevant levels of governance. 
The data collected will include: 
/square6 Progress on specific projects;   
/square6 Details of the performance of the variables contrib uting to the emissions in the quarter 
such as utilities, water, fuel, waste generated. 
Other Reporting Requirements 
Comhairle nan Eilean Siar will continue to fulfil r equirements to report on environmental 
performance through a range of mechanisms such as t he Sustainable Scotland Networks 
online reporting platform for Climate change.
