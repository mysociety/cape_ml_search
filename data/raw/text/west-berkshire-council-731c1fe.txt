climate change is recognised across the 
globe. There is an increasing need for 
action if we are to respond to the danger 
this poses to our people, our wildlife and our 
environment. Locally , we took an important step 
by acknowledging this when West Berkshire 
Council unanimously declared a Climate 
Emergency on 2nd July 2019. In doing so 
we highlighted the fact that the Council, our 
partners and our local communities all needed 
to play their part in response.
On 28th October 2019 we held our first West 
Berkshire Climate Conference at which we 
committed to taking a leading role locally .  We 
asked for comments and suggestions at the 
conference which have now been built into the 
strategy that follows.There are some initiatives we have already 
committed to making a start on since January 
2019 which we know will make a positive 
contribution to protecting and preserving our 
natural environment as well as to becoming 
carbon neutral by 2030.  These include:
• installing more solar panels across 
our estate, aiming for a significant 
contribution from solar energy towards 
the Council’s energy consumption and 
beyond;
• continuing to increase the number of 
charging points for electric vehicles in 
West Berkshire;
• conducting a Council carbon audit so 
we understand our challenges and be 
better placed to become carbon neutral 
by 2030;1. Foreword
4    STRATEGY 2020-30There are also other projects that we intend to 
explore in the coming years which, alongside 
offsetting and mitigation activities, will help us 
along the path to a greener and carbon neutral 
West Berkshire by 2030. These will be turned 
into a detailed delivery plan to accompany this 
strategy .
We also recognise the vital role the government 
has in creating an environment to enable 
delivery and we will lobby for changes to 
national planning policies and building 
regulations which will be key to our success.
While we want to lead on this important issue, 
we know the Council cannot deliver this 
strategy alone: everyone in West Berkshire 
has a role to play . The changes we are all able 
to make will vary in size but all are important 
as we work towards our shared aspiration. A 
comment was made at the recent conference 
that we all need to consider our own priorities 
and behaviours if we are to rise to the 
challenge that climate change presents to us 
all.  The Council wants to do precisely this 
through the publication of this strategy , which 
we hope will act as a catalyst to residents, 
businesses and interested groups. This Council, over successive administrations, 
has a strong record of responding to green 
issues.   However with the declaration of a 
Climate Emergency we recognise that we need 
to accelerate activity in the face of growing 
concern for our planet’s future. This will mean 
being bolder , and prioritising investment in 
environmental projects to a much greater 
extent than we have to date.  
Most importantly , we know that trying to reach 
carbon neutrality without the active involvement 
of the residents, businesses and communities 
of West Berkshire would not be possible. I 
would therefore urge you to read this strategy 
and to join with others across our community  
to think about what action you can take to make 
its aims a reality .
Cllr Steve Ardagh-Walter 
Portfolio holder for EnvironmentSTRATEGY 2020-30    5
The delivery of this document, West Berkshire Council’s new Environment Strategy , has been 
accelerated as a result of the Council declaring a Climate Emergency in July 2019 and committing to 
the creation of a strategic plan to work towards carbon neutrality in the district by 2030. 
This declaration was as follows:2. Introduction
This Council notes that:
1. All levels of government (national, regional and local) have a responsibility to limit 
the negative impacts of climate breakdown. It is important for the residents of West 
Berkshire and the UK that we commit to working towards carbon neutrality as quickly 
as possible.
2. The consequences of global temperature rising above 1.5°C are so severe that 
preventing this from happening must be of the utmost urgency .
3.  Bold climate action can deliver economic benefits in terms of new jobs, economic 
savings and market opportunities (as well as improved health and wellbeing) but will 
also require changes in individuals’ lifestyles and have a cost implication to both the 
individual and the state.
West Berkshire Council therefore:
• Declares a Climate Emergency .
• Will create a strategic plan for West Berkshire that aims to deliver carbon neutrality 
by 2030.
• Calls on HM Government to provide the Council with the powers and resources to 
make the 2030 target possible.
• Will work with other authorities to determine and implement where practicable best 
practice methods to limit global warming to less than 1.5°C.
This document reflects the comments made at 
the council’s first Climate Conference on 28th 
October 2019 as well as evidence we have 
about the district’s current carbon footprint. 
It has been made available to the whole 
community for a period of consultation. This 
detailed consultation and engagement has 
brought about changes to the strategy to form 
this final document, which has been approved 
by the Council’s Executive. This strategy sets out a Vision for the local 
environment in which we would like our 
communities to live  by 2030. We have linked 
this to the needs for a strong local economy 
supported by responsible growth, and for 
our local population to be healthy and have 
a positive sense of wellbeing. Central to this 
Vision is the expectation that all of the district’s 
residents and businesses will contribute 
towards the aspiration of becoming a carbon 6    STRATEGY 2020-30neutral district by 2030. Achieving this goal 
will need all of us to prioritise care for the 
environment in our actions and decisions.
The strategy also contains a number of 
proposed actions which give an indication of 
how we are proposing to put the strategy into 
action.  There is a lot to do and the Council will 
have neither the resources nor the time to do 
everything at once, or in isolation.  Some of the 
issues that need to be addressed locally will 
be outside our direct control needing action 
by our partners and local communities.  In 
recognising this, our aim is to be ambitious but 
also realistic in terms of what can be achieved 
in the face of a deliberately challenging target: 
carbon neutrality by 2030.Over time, this strategy will adapt to reflect 
changes to the local and national picture. 
The impact of COVID19 will also be central 
to our thinking along with maximising the 
environmental benefits through our recovery 
plans.  
Perhaps most importantly , the strategy 
highlights the need to engage all of our 
communities in taking action.  The Council will 
seek to take the lead by putting our ‘own house 
in order’ but this strategy cannot be delivered 
by us alone. Throughout the lifespan of the 
strategy we will review progress annually to 
ensure the direction we have chosen is still 
appropriate.STRATEGY 2020-30    73. Context
The Paris Agreement, which was signed on 
12th December 2015, was the first time that the 
overwhelming majority of national governments 
acknowledged that climate change was a tangible, severe and, importantly , man-made 
threat to the prosperity and wellbeing of 
current and future generations in all countries 
across the world.

Figure 1. CCC Infographic1 8    STRATEGY 2020-30Whilst it is true that the climate has and will 
continue to change naturally , the scientific 
evidence is clear that it is changing rapidly, 
primarily as a result of human activity .  Global 
warming is evident from observations of 
increases in global average air and ocean 
temperatures, widespread melting of snow 
and ice and rising sea levels.  Records also 
show that there is now almost 40% more 
carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, in 
the atmosphere, than there was before the 
industrial revolution. This represents a level not 
experienced for at least the last 800,000 years.  
Consequently , the global average temperatures 
continue to rise. Indeed 2000 – 2009 was the 
warmest decade for over 150 years whilst 
2010-2019 was the second warmest. 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) in 2007 produced a very 
comprehensive and detailed scientific 
assessment of past, present and future 
climate change. As a result of this work, it was 
recognised that an average global temperature 
rise of no more than 2°C is required to avert 
the worst potential consequences of climate 
change. 
The Paris Agreement formalised this 
recognition and has as its central aim to keep a 
global temperature rise this century well below 
2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue 
efforts to limit the temperature increase even 
further to 1.5°C .
Nationally, the Climate Change Act 2008 
provides the framework for UK climate change 
policy .  Long term targets were subsequently 
set and the Committee on Climate Change 
(CCC) was established as an independent 
body to advise Government.  The Government 
produced its Clean Growth Strategy in 
2017 and the CCC has also produced a 
comprehensive range of reports about the 
issue.  A central recommendation was a 
new emissions target for the UK – net zero 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
In May 2019 a motion was passed by the UK 
Parliament seeking to declare an environment 
and climate emergency .  This effectively 
endorsed the net zero by 2050 target 
previously recommended by the CCC.  In 
addition, the CCC commented in response 
to the declared environment and climate 
emergency that:• delivery must progress with far greater 
urgency;
• challenges that have not been 
confronted must now be addressed; 
• were imports considered, statistics 
suggest that emissions would be much 
higher as countries increasingly import 
the good that they consume;
• clear leadership is needed, right across 
Government, with delivery in partnership 
with businesses and communities; and
• overall costs are manageable but must 
be fairly distributed.
Encouragingly , national figures show that UK 
greenhouse gas emissions have decreased in 
recent years, with the exception of 2012 where 
emissions were 3.5% higher than in 2011, and 
that it has been possible to decouple economic 
growth and carbon emissions. However , these 
figures only take into account emissions 
produced in the UK, not the emissions from 
all the goods and services imported and 
consumed in the UK. 
West Berkshire has not been immune from 
the impact of climate change. Flooding has 
become more prevalent with notable events 
in 2003, 2007, 2012 and 2013 impacting 
on thousands of residents and homes. The 
scale of the flooding was at a level which had 
not been witnessed in a generation. Whilst 
such events have been challenging, the 
general trend has been towards warmer and 
drier conditions with drought becoming an 
increasing concern. This has perhaps been 
most evident in the River Kennet where in 
recent years the river has run dry in its upper 
reaches.
One of West Berkshire’s biggest strengths is 
its strong, balanced economy . This is, however , 
reliant on the district’s several major transport 
arteries, most notably the M4 and A34.  These 
two roads alone account for over 50% of all 
the CO2 generated from transport activity each 
year , and around 30% of the district’s total CO2 
emissions. This is a significant proportion and 
yet it is something that is entirely outside of 
the control of West Berkshire Council. For this 
reason, we will explore later on in the strategy 
what we have the power to actively change 
and, where this is not the case, how we can 
consider the power of persuasion to influence 
external factors such as these. STRATEGY 2020-30    9Another one of West Berkshire’s greatest 
assets is its predominantly rural nature, with 
74% of the district sitting within a designated 
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . As well 
as the lifestyle opportunities this offers, it also 
increases the potential for carbon capture and 
the exploration of carbon-free and renewable 
forms of energy . Not only this, but it will play a 
vital role in supporting and further enhancing 
the biodiversity of the district.  We know that 
we will have to find better ways to engage 
with our many landowners, farmers and wider 
agricultural businesses to ensure a joined up 
approach.
Importantly , this strategy does not sit in 
isolation from what we are seeking to do to 
make West Berkshire a better place to live, 
work, learn and visit. Instead, it seeks to 
complement our wider work, as illustrated in 
Figure 2, which began with the development 
of the West Berkshire 2036 Vision and will 
continue with the publication of a range of 
strategies for the district’s future. 
Carbon reduction and wider environmental 
objectives will influence all aspects of the 
Council Strategy .Risks and uncertainty associated with our 
journey are significant and as knowledge of 
and access to technical data increases, some 
assumptions may have had to be made along 
the way . As part of our journey through the 
delivery of this strategy there will need to be 
significant development of our knowledge, 
particularly on how both individual carbon 
reduction and carbon offset projects will 
contribute to the vision and our targets.
Information and data2
Inevitably it can be challenging to establish 
the right datasets to rely upon when making 
decisions or setting strategic direction. The 
government produced a ‘National Atmospheric 
Emissions Inventory’3  to help design carbon 
reduction strategies and this, in our opinion, 
is the best overall summary to guide us at this 
stage in our journey . According to this, West 
Berkshire produced 1,294.5 ktonnes of CO2 
in 2017, or 8.2 tonnes of CO2 per resident. 
The figure represents a 26.4% reduction since 
2005 which represents a significant amount of 
progress. 
When compared to the rest of the UK, however , 
CO2 production per capita4  is at the higher

In reviewing the types of emissions and 
Chart 1: Local Authority CO2 Emissions
their comparative scale, it is clear that in 
West Berkshire electricity from Industry and 
Commercial and gas from domestic are key areas to address. This is best reflected in Chart 
2 below:
Chart 2: Emissions breakdown within West Berkshire.   Emission estimates within the scope of 
Local Authorities5
As part of the National Atmospheric Emissions 
Inventory the Government also published 
a ‘subset dataset’ which represents CO2 
emissions within the scope of influence of 
Local Authorities. This amended dataset 
removed motorways (M4), EU Emissions 
Trading System (EU ETS) sites (e.g. AWE and 
other larger industrial sites), diesel railways 
and what are known as Land Use (direct 
human-induced land use such as settlements 
and commercial uses6), Land Use Change 
and Forestry (LULUCF) Chart 3 shows the 
significance of the impact on the picture for 
West Berkshire.  
These amendments affect different Local 
Authorities in different ways but overall no local 
authority had an increase in emissions within 
this scope between 2005  and 2017. Table 1 
gives a comparison with neighbouring Local 
Authorities.

section go some way to highlighting the scale 
of the challenge in West Berkshire, as well 
as offering some global and national context. 
What follows in this strategy is a representation of what we feel we must do, in partnership 
with our local residents, businesses and 
stakeholders, in order to address this.Chart 4 below shows how, in West Berkshire, 
both Industry , Commercial and Domestic have 
seen a reduction in emissions since 2005, but 
transport has been steady since 2013, with 
small increases in recent years. This will help 
inform the Delivery Plan.In 2005 West Berkshire’s emission estimate 
was 1,317 ktonnes of CO2 and by 2017 this 
reduced to 917.2 ktonnes of CO2 (30%) 
expressed in per capita terms this is 5.8 tonnes 
of CO2. The average reduction since 2005 has 
been 0.25 tonnes of CO2 per year (9.0 down 
to 5.8 tonnes per capita), this is slightly ahead 
of the national average at 0.22 (7.4 down to 4.5 
tonnes per capita).Emission estimates within the scope of Local Authorities  
As part of the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory the Government also 
published a ‘subset dataset’ which represents CO 2 emissions within the scope of 
influence of Local Authorities. This amended dataset removed motorways (M4), EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) sites (e.g. AWE and other larger industrial sites), 
diesel railways and what are known as Land Use (direct human- induced land use such 
as settlements and commercial uses), Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). The 
effect of this was to reduce emissions in West Berkshire by 65,000t, compared to other 
LA’s this is quite high and explains how significant these sources of pollution are 
locally. Using this data it is possible to plot a future trajectory for emissions reductions. 
This data has assumptions within it and will need to be regularly revised but based on 
a continuation of the ‘current’ (2005 to 2017) rate of improvement in emissions it gives 
an indication of where west Berkshire will be in 2030.  
Chart 3: Possible future trajectory of  CO 2 Emissions in West Berkshire  
 
In West Berkshire, both Industr y, Commercial and Domestic have seen a reduction in 
emissions since 2005, but transport has been steady since 2013, with small increases 
in recent years. For this reason, we will outline and deliver a number of projects we 
intend to pursue in order to miti gate this in the lifetime of this strategy.

Mitigation of  the effects of  climate change 
and the restoration and protection of  our 
environment will have shaped our policy 
making and actions, as well as those of  our 
partners, and will have made a significant 
impact on the district’s carbon footprint.
Our environmental assets will have been 
protected for future generations. 
The residents, businesses and communities 
of  West Berkshire will continue to be active 
partners in delivering positive change. These will have included lifestyle changes, more 
effective use of  energy , the adoption of  new 
technology , efficient running of  our public 
services and new, or adapted, infrastructure.
Progress towards carbon neutrality will have 
been made alongside the district’s other 
strategic priorities, including protecting 
and supporting the vulnerable, improving 
educational outcomes, maintaining a high 
quality of  life for residents, and a strong local 
economy .14    STRATEGY 2020-304.1 Key targets to deliver the Vision for 
the Environment
4.1.1 We will aim to reduce annual total 
emissions to less than 350 ktonnes by 2030 
(Based on emission estimates within the scope 
of influence of Local Authorities)
• Per person, this is a reduction from 
around 6 tonnes (level in 20177) to 2 
tonnes of CO2.
• This equates to an average annual 
reduction of more than 40 ktonnes over 
the period.
• This would leave total emissions, before 
additional activities, at 350 ktonnes in 
2030.
• Information will be drawn from the 
Governments national and regional 
emissions dataset but we will seek 
to supplement this with wider data 
gathering with the support of technical 
advise and academic advice.
4.1.2 Carbon Neutrality will be achieved by a 
range of local energy generation and carbon 
sequestration8 projects equivalent to the 
projected emission level of 350 ktonnes.
• We will, at the same time as progressing 
our carbon reduction projects, 
implement a number of measures which 
aim towards a target of 350 ktonnes for 
carbon offset9.
• Examples will include solar and wind 
energy generation; tree planting; and 
other techniques
• This target needs to be achieved by 
the whole district: local residents, 
landowners and business will be 
encouraged to engage in energy 
generation or carbon sequestration 
where reduction is not possible. 4.1.3 The Council will be a carbon neutral 
operation by 2030.
• This will be established using a suitable 
methodology10.
• This does not include all Scope 3 
emissions (indirect emissions are 
excluded but will be closely monitored 
to ensure we know where to focus our 
efforts when lobbying the government 
and influencing behavioural change 
initiatives).

Environment Vision
CARBON NEUTRAL BY 2030
• Ambitious but realistic targets.
• Deliver a range of local energy generation and carbon sequestration projects.
• The Council will be a carbon neutral operation by 2030.
• Technical and Academic advice to be sought to inform the delivery plan.
RESPONSIBLE ECONOMIC GROWTH
• Investigate how green incentives for business can be integrated into the Council’s 
Economic Development Strategy .
• Emphasise farming and agriculture in the local economy .
• Invest in digital infrastructure and the skills of young people
• Design effective communications to help grow new and existing local green business
WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITIES AND PARTNERS
•  Improve the overall communications process to ensure our communities have the 
information they need to make good environmental decisions.
•  Improve our use of technology to improve accessibility to environmental information, 
events and debate.HEALTHY COMMUNITIES
• Maintaining and enhancing our green and blue spaces and encourage poeople  
to use it.
• Focus on improving life outcomes for the children, young people and adults in our 
district.
• Maximise active travel opportunity .
• Deliver projects which encourage active travel.
RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE
•  Maintain high quality flood management strategies and sustainable drainage for new 
and existing infrastructure which improve community resilience.
•  Explore adaptation measures to reduce vulnerability to climate change.
•  Develop good relationships with communities and effective communication on risk. 16    STRATEGY 2020-305.1 Carbon Neutral by 2030
Most of the actions driven by this strategy will 
be to reduce local CO2 emission levels as 
much as possible.   Achieving zero emissions 
is not a realistic target, so we will also seek 
to generate clean energy or sequester an 
equivalent amount of CO2 in order to achieve 
net zero.
Firstly , we need to better understand the 
district’s and the Council’s emissions. We have 
started this process as part of the research for 
this strategy i.e. What are they , where are they , 
how are they measured and reported, who is 
responsible for them and how can these be 
influenced. We know that we will need to have 
answered these before we can move forward 
with any certainty and ability to measure how 
we are doing.
As mentioned earlier in the Context section, 
the Government already produces national 
and regional CO2 emissions data down to level 
of local authority administrative areas. This 
data helps identify the key sources of CO2 
emissions in each area and allows changes in CO2 emissions over time to be monitored and 
can help mitigation actions to be targeted. 
There are two limitations to this dataset. The 
first is that it is solely concerned with carbon 
dioxide emissions and doesn’t take into 
account other greenhouse gas emissions. 
The second is that the various sources of 
information, coupled with the complexity and 
amount of data collected, all takes time to 
analyse and calculate for each Local Authority 
area. As a result, the final statistics are only 
released a full two years after the actual year 
they concern. This means that we won’t have 
confirmed data for 2030 until 2032.
We recognise these limitations but feel that this 
dataset is the best currently available method 
for measuring the district’s carbon footprint and 
will work with it for now.
The actions and detail behind what will need 
to be implemented in order to achieve the 
2030 target will come later with the creation, 
adoption and launch of the associated 
‘Delivery Plan’.
STRATEGY 2020-30    17Actions currently being considered include, but 
are not limited to, the following:
• Exploring the use of ‘Climate Change 
Bonds’ to help deliver a wide variety of 
infrastructure projects;
• Energy Mapping and Master Planning 
- It has been established that one of 
the key areas to significantly reduce 
the districts carbon emissions is 
decarbonising the way in which the 
district’s homes and businesses are 
heated;  
• Replacing existing internal combustion 
engine (ICE) vehicles on the Council’s 
fleet with Ultra Low Emission Vehicles 
(ULEV) along with the early development 
and adoption of a low emission vehicle 
strategy .
• Waste reduction activities;
• Setting individual ‘Carbon budgets’ 
for Council based operations (see 
‘Managing our own carbon budget’);
• Implementation of Council and district 
wide energy efficiency schemes;
• Increasing the deployment of renewable 
energy technology across the Council’s 
estate; and
• Carbon sequestration such as large 
scale tree planting e.g. through 
schemes such as the Woodland Carbon 
Code and Associated Fund11.
• Renewable energy infrastructure will be 
installed on all Council sites where it is 
feasible to do so.
5.2 Responsible Economic Growth
In the West Berkshire 2036 Vision and in our 
Economic Development Strategy , we made 
it clear that our local economy is strong, 
diverse and resilient. This is at the heart of our 
success as a district and is something we are 
committed to maintaining so that everyone is 
able to benefit from it.
The emerging threat of climate change and 
the need to address it need not change this 
stance. Decoupling emissions and economic 
growth is already a reality in the world’s major 
economies. In recent years, most of the 
countries that have cut their emissions have 
also grown their economies. The UK cut its 
emissions by 128m tonnes of CO2 between 2000 and 2014, a 20% reduction whilst 
experiencing GDP growth of 27%12.
Making this leap was no accident. It came 
as the result of a combination of deliberate 
environmentally friendly policy making and a 
shift of the UK economy from more carbon-
intensive manufacturing to less carbon-
intensive service-based industries.
Although the shift in our local economy’s 
industrial makeup has not moved as 
significantly as this national trend given that 
manufacturing is not one of the district’s 
primary industries; we are committed to using 
our own policy making and influence locally 
as we work alongside our businesses to 
accelerate this at a local level. 
In April 2018, the Thames Valley Berkshire 
Local Enterprise Partnership assessed 
Berkshire’s future energy needs relating to 
economic growth13. The study assessed both 
the impacts of the future energy needs of 
existing communities and businesses and 
the potential impact of new growth. The 
results showed that the success and speed 
of economic growth in the area is likely to 
out-pace energy infrastructure provision as 
currently planned. This presents a significant 
risk to our local economy and we will need to 
redress this. 
Although much of this activity will be market-
led, there are a number of ways in which 
we are able to influence the direction of the 
economy and the behaviour of our businesses 
to ensure that our target of carbon neutrality 
can be combined with continued economic 
success. 
For instance: 
• We will continue to use our planning 
system to ensure that all commercial 
developments meet a minimum 
environmental standard so that any 
adverse impacts associated with new 
buildings are minimised.
• We will lobby Government to enforce 
higher standards and encourage the 
adoption of modern building techniques 
e.g. factory built eco housing, where 
possible.

and Smart Cities initiatives so that 
businesses are able to take advantage 
of the benefits this brings, such as at 
home working and connected devices.
• We will improve signposting on our 
website and social media channels as 
well as through the literature we publish 
so that businesses of all sizes are able 
to access the information they need in 
order to make the most environmentally 
conscious choices available to them.
• Through investment in the skills of our 
young people, we will also ensure that 
employers have access to a workforce 
which is well-informed about the impact 
of climate change and is equipped to 
carry out the green jobs of the future.
• We will provide designated business 
advice to new and existing green 
businesses so that those who are 
innovating in this area are given the 
opportunity and support to grow.
• We will explore initiatives to incentivise 
good practice among our businesses 
such as business rate reviews, 
environmental excellence awards or 
accreditations and the use of ‘greening’ 
bursaries. 
• We will investigate how ‘Green 
Incentives’ for businesses may be 
applied within West Berkshire and 
incorporated in the Council’s Economic 
Development Strategy .
Through the development of the delivery plan 
we will set out how we intend to carry out these 
actions; securing inclusive and responsible 
economic growth for our district.
5.3 Healthy Communities
As we mentioned in the West Berkshire 
2036 Vision, we are committed to continuing 
to support the achievement of healthy 
communities and positive life outcomes by 
every single local resident.
Given that the links between an active lifestyle, 
good air quality , access to green and blue 
space and health are clear , we intend to 
promote and continue to deliver these benefits 
by working alongside our Health and Wellbeing 
Board.
As we have mentioned in other chapters, 
STRATEGY 2020-30    19we have seen significant investment in 
infrastructure that enables residents to use 
more sustainable transport options. Integral 
to this is Cycle Route 422, which runs east 
to west through Berkshire, as well as our 
work to ensure that our footpaths are kept in 
good order . We have also implemented (in 
partnership with Reading Borough Council) 
a Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure 
Programme (LCWIP), introduced as part 
of the Government’s Cycling and Walking 
Investment Strategy , which will enable a long-
term approach to developing local cycling and 
walking networks. 
Alongside this infrastructure, we have rolled 
out a number of initiatives to encourage active 
travel, such as Go Kinetic, Walk to School 
Week and Bikeability . Encouraging active travel 
in this way is beneficial for the overall health 
and wellbeing of children and also results 
in reduced vehicle emissions and improved 
local air quality . Through better use of 
communications and engagement, we will build 
on this work to further enhance the health and 
wellbeing of our residents.
Maintaining and enhancing our green and blue 
spaces so that future generations are able to 
enjoy them and, importantly , are equipped to 
take on their stewardship will also be vital to 
the continuation of good health and wellbeing 
opportunities. 
This will then further improve the life outcomes 
for the children, young people and adults in our 
district. 
We will work with schools, businesses, charities 
and other partner organisations to:
• Help our residents to improve their 
health and wellbeing by using our green 
and blue spaces, taking advantage of 
our outstanding natural environment and 
by working in partnership with available 
wellbeing and mental health services;
• Encourage more people to spend time 
in our green spaces to benefit their 
health and wellbeing;
• Encourage children to be closer to 
nature, in and out of school; 
• Plan a year of action for the 
environment, working with our partners 
to encourage local children and young 
people to interact with nature and help improve the natural environment; 
• Continue to provide active travel (e.g. 
cycling) training to school children
• Use available LCWIP funding to further 
expand the provision of cycling 
infrastructure 
5.4 Resilient to Climate Change
The ability to adapt to a change in climate 
is at the forefront of work being conducted 
by the Adaptation Committee14  (part of the 
Committee on Climate Change) and has 
resulted in long-term planning for flood risk 
and water resources management, increased 
investment in flood defences, changes in policy 
to improve sustainable drainage systems 
(SuDS) and reviewing policies related to 
overheating in buildings through the Building 
Regulations and National Planning Policy 
Framework.
• Help our residents to improve their 
health and wellbeing by using our green 
and blue spaces, taking advantage of 
our outstanding natural environment and 
by working in partnership with available 
wellbeing and mental health services;
• Encourage more people to spend time 
in our green spaces to benefit their 
health and wellbeing;
• Encourage children to be closer to 
nature, in and out of school;
• Plan a year of action for the 
environment, working with our partners 
to encourage local children and young 
people to interact with nature and help 
improve the natural environment; 
• Continue to provide active travel (e.g. 
cycling) training to school children
• Use available LCWIP funding to further 
expand the provision of cycling 
infrastructure
West Berkshire has experience of this and, 
through the Local Flood Risk Management 
Strategy15, there has been a concerted effort 
to minimise the effects of future flood events 
on residents and businesses because we 
have seen the direct impact on people’s lives, 
possessions, and their physical and mental 
health. 
A series of flood management plans have been 
developed, looking at site specific risks and the 
different types of flood risk that West Berkshire 
[14] https://www.theccc.org.uk/our-impact/resilience-to-climate-change/ 
[15] https://info.westberks.gov .uk/floodriskmanagement 20    STRATEGY 2020-30is likely to experience (ground water , river , 
surface water , sewer and highway). We have 
worked with all of the affected communities 
in developing these plans and there is a 
comprehensive response plan in place should 
such an event happen in the future. As with all 
major incidents, this is a multi-agency response 
and we work through the Thames Valley Local 
Resilience Forum16 to ensure that communities  
are provided with the very important 
information they need to prepare themselves.
We have also progressed a comprehensive 
approach towards SuDS and policy has been 
developed to ensure adequate protections are 
in place for new development17, this is a key 
part of our work to improve adaptation and 
resilience.
Adaptation measures will be explored to help 
reduce vulnerability – for example by lowering 
sensitivity or building adaptive capacity – as 
well as allowing communities and partners to 
benefit from opportunities of climatic changes.
5.5 Working with Our Communities
We recognise that we have an important part 
to play in achieving carbon neutrality but we 
cannot fulfil this ambition alone. From everyday 
behaviours and lifestyle choices such as the 
mode of transport we use and the food that we 
eat, to longer term investments in new buildings 
and infrastructure, all of our decisions need to 
consider the carbon impact. 
We will therefore work closely and inclusively 
with those that represent the diverse nature of 
West Berkshire to not only understand what 
their priorities are and to learn from these 
but also to increase awareness and enable 
informed decisions. In doing so our Town and 
Parish Councils will be important partners, as 
will our businesses. 
We will also work closely with landowners and 
farming/ agricultural communities to explore 
opportunities for natural sequestration through 
environmental land management techniques. 
If we are to meet our target of carbon neutrality 
by 2030, however , it will be necessary to 
accelerate our work. As such, we will continue to use available tools e.g. social media 
platforms and info-graphics as well as events 
and a strategic communications strategy to 
engage better with our residents, businesses 
and visitors about transport, waste and 
resource use in the future as we look towards a 
carbon neutral future in West Berkshire.

2030
6.1 Key Themes
6.1.1 Sustainable Transport
West Berkshire has a successful local economy 
which owes much to its strategic location within 
the Thames Valley with its close proximity to the 
M4, good- and improving- rail links and access 
to Heathrow Airport and London. Living in the 
district also brings with it excellent lifestyle 
opportunities, many of which are linked to its 
rural nature and proximity to the North Wessex 
Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty .
What is clear , however , is that these advantages 
bring with them carbon emissions. 
As indicated in our context section, local 
transport currently accounts for a significant 
proportion of our emissions and we know 
this is something we can seek to influence. 
The M4 and A34, our two most important 
strategic roads, account for a large amount of 
emissions from transport yet sit mainly outside 
of Local Authority control. As such, the further 
development of sustainable transport solutions 
will be key as we look to reduce the district’s 
carbon footprint and fulfil our ambitions to preserve and enhance our natural environment.
Much of this work has started as part of our 
Local Transport Plan (LTP) to 2026. The Vision 
of this plan is:
“To deliver effective transport solutions for 
all by increasing choice and minimising 
congestion”
We have already made progress in this area. 
For instance, we have installed a large number 
of electric vehicle charging points in residential 
streets across the district and have one of the 
highest numbers per capita in the country , far 
exceeding any other Berkshire Local Authority 
area. We have also, with the Thames Valley 
Berkshire Local Enterprise Partnership, seen 
significant investment in cycle paths and, with 
the help of a Department for Transport grant, 
established a car club in Newbury . That said, 
there is scope to do more.
We will review our Local Transport Plan in order 
to build on the progress we have made. As 
part of this, we are considering a number of 
projects which will reduce carbon emissions 22    STRATEGY 2020-30and environmental harm whilst offering a 
greater number of transport options to our 
residents. These include:
• Working with public transport 
operators to improve the use of public 
transport.
• Establishing greater connections 
between sustainable travel options.
• Encouraging more sustainable car 
travel options where use of public 
transport and active travel is not 
practical.
• Supporting active travel especially for 
shorter journeys.
• Working with local businesses to 
promote sustainable travel by staff.
• Encouraging uptake of electric 
vehicles by continuing to provide 
exemplar levels of charging points.
• Increasing our use of more 
sustainable road surfacing options e.g. 
low-temperature asphalt.
• Working with our stakeholders and 
partners to develop and adopt 
sustainable transport innovations
• Working with the Government, regional 
and local partners to enhance rail 
infrastructure.
• Lobbying national Government and 
relevant agencies in areas where 
emissions are outside of our control 
(e.g. Highways Agency in the case of 
the M4 and A34).
6.1.2 Buildings
The Council will move to buying green energy 
for all its buildings and will seek to influence 
others to do the same. All our own services and 
support functions will be encouraged to review 
their use of buildings with a view to improving 
our chances of success in achieving carbon-
neutrality within our infrastructure.
All of our new build or refurbishment projects 
shall take into consideration the carbon impact 
of their proposal, both in construction and 
operation. The positive and negative impacts, 
in line with the intentions of this strategy , will 
be measured and managed in a move towards 
‘whole life’ carbon costing and decision making. We acknowledge that there will be 
difficult decisions to make in achieving this, but 
want to show ambition and determination in our 
approach. To help achieve this we will:
Energy used to heat homes accounts for a 
substantial percentage of the Districts carbon 
emissions.  Whilst we will commit to lobbying 
government to improve energy performance 
standards in new builds, we are also conscious 
that huge reductions in carbon emissions 
and energy requirements of current housing 
stock is achievable and needs to be done.  
Retrofitting insulation and energy efficient 
heating systems will deliver multiple benefits to 
homeowners and the environment and we will 
engage, lobby and support for the necessary 
changes to make retrofitting economical.
• Review and assess emerging 
technology and share our knowledge 
with stakeholders and communities.
• Communicate with local landlords 
(in our capacity as enforcing 
agncy for the Energy Performance 
of Building Regulations 2012) 
and owners/occupiers of public 
buildings to ensure they are aware 
of their obligations to improve energy 
efficiency .
• Advise residents and businesses of 
best practice where possible.
• Explore ways to make retrofitting 
insulation and energy efficient heating 
systems more economically viable.
6.1.3 Energy
The Council’s electricity consumption in 
2018/19 was estimated to be 11,630 MWh, 
equivalent to 3 kTonnes CO2. Across West 
Berkshire as a whole, the Industry and 
Commercial sector emitted 141.0 kTonnes 
CO2 as a result of electricity consumption 
compared with the Domestic sector which 
emitted an equivalent 81.7 kTonnes of CO2.
We recognise, therefore, that of the district’s 
total of 222.7 kTonnes of CO2 in 2017 
(resulting from electricity consumption) our 
CO2 emissions only account for 1.35% and we 
need to show leadership to positively influence 
others.
The UK’s plans to reduce carbon emissions 
[18] https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40198567 
[19] https://www.gov .uk/government/statistics/renewable-sources-of-energy-chapter-6-digest-of-
united-kingdom-energy-statistics-dukesSTRATEGY 2020-30    23have relied on ensuring that we generate our 
electricity and heat from low or zero carbon 
sources instead of the coal and gas currently 
used. Good progress is being made nationally . 
In June 201718 National Grid reported that for 
the first time power from wind, solar , hydro 
and wood pellet burning supplied 50.7% of 
UK energy for a brief period during 1 day . 
Renewable sources provided a third (33.0 per 
cent) of the total electricity generated in the UK 
in 2018 compared to 29.2 per cent in 201719
West Berkshire is a rural authority and this 
brings its own particular challenges and 
opportunities when considering the impact of 
the district’s existing energy consumption and 
the potential for renewable energy .
As a district, in 2018, for renewable energy 
sources, West Berkshire had 34.2 MW installed 
capacity , the vast majority of which came from 
solar photovoltaics (33.1 MW)20. Table 3 on the 
right shows how this compares with others.
Whilst the potential for renewable energy 
generated from solar photovoltaics appears 
to be well established, things are not so clear 
with regards the ability to provide low and zero 
carbon heat for homes and businesses. A large 
proportion of the district’s existing homes are 
reliant on liquid fuels and have no cost efficient 
way of connecting to the local gas grid, a less 
carbon intensive method to heating homes. To 
overcome this we will:
• undertake energy mapping and 
master planning for the district in 
order to better understand what 
opportunities and limitations there 
are for district heating schemes 
with existing buildings and future 
developments. The results of this 
exercise would be used to inform any 
relevant future policy for the district
• work with local suppliers, community 
energy co-operatives and similar 
groups to invest in renewable 
energy in the district, and will lobby 
Government to change the tax 
system to favour low and zero carbon 
solutions.6.1.4 Waste and Resource Efficiency
As the world’s population has grown in recent 
decades, and with it material consumption and 
waste generation, it has become increasingly 
obvious that major changes are required to 
conserve the earth’s finite resources. 
As a unitary authority , we have statutory duties 
for both waste collection and disposal. We 
have set out a Waste Strategy 2002 – 202221 
, but we recognise a lot has changed in the 
UK waste sector since it was published. 
We are committed to providing residents 
with a good quality of waste collection and 
recycling service. In the medium term, we will 
also have to ensure that our collections and 
recycling approach is compliant with emerging 
government requirements, which are expected 
to apply from April 2023.
According to the United Nations22, if the 
global population reaches 9.6 billion by 2050, 
the equivalent of almost three planets could 
be needed to provide the natural resources 
required to sustain current lifestyles. For 
this reason, there has recently been greater 
emphasis on the need to transition economies 
from the historical linear (“take, make and 
dispose”) model of resource use, to a more 
circular economic model where materials are 
kept in use for longer to minimise the need for 
raw materials. This is demonstrated in Figure 3 
overleaf:

data/file/765914/resources-waste-strategy-dec-2018.pdf
[24] http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/the-uk-plastics-pactThe Resources and Waste Strategy for England 
(RWS)23 was published in December 2018 
and seeks to deliver the waste and resource 
management elements of the UK Government’s 
25 Year Environment Plan. The RWS has the 
overall aim of making the UK a world leader 
in resource efficiency and to facilitate the 
transition to this circular economy . 
Two of the key targets set out in this RWS are:
• for all plastics to be reusable, recyclable 
and compostable by 2025; and
• to eliminate avoidable plastic waste by 
2042. 
In addition, according to information available 
in the Government’s initial consultation on the 
RWS during spring 2019, some of the changes 
that may be required to our existing collections 
include:
• A requirement to collect food waste 
separately from the kerbside on at least 
a weekly basis; and
• A requirement for all English local 
authorities to collect the same core set 
of dry recyclable materials 
We know that plastic waste is something our 
residents feel very strongly about. We intend to 
look at how we can tackle this locally . 
We are aware from compositional surveys of 
the residual waste bins in West Berkshire that 
about 25% of the contents is comprised of food waste. By providing separate food waste 
collections, we have given the community the 
tools they need to improve this statistic. We 
will therefore encourage them to consider 
how changes might be made to their own 
recycling habits so that the amount of waste 
unnecessarily sent to landfill is minimised. 
Recycling in the commercial and industrial 
sector has traditionally been much lower than 
for household and municipal waste so it is likely 
that there is scope to undertake significant 
work in this area. Major UK business are 
adopting numerous initiatives to reduce plastic 
pollution such as the launch of the Plastics 
Pact24, whose signatories include some of 
the leading UK retailers, producers and Non-
Governmental Organisations but, as always, 
there is a pressing need to do more. Effective 
communications and engagement will be key 
to this, as we discuss in other parts of this 
strategy .
We already have some strong examples of 
good practice in our waste operations. In 
2018/19, about 50% (c. 37,000 tonnes) of the 
waste we collected was either recycled or 
composted, about 34% (c. 25,000 tonnes) was 
sent to an energy recovery facility and 16% (c. 
12,000 tonnes) was landfilled. This places us 
among the better performing local authorities 
in England. Nevertheless, we are determined 
to recycle even more in the lifetime of this 
strategy . We are also committed to ensuring 
that only materials for which a proven offtake 
market exists are collected for recycling and 
that, wherever practicable, waste is sent to 
facilities within the UK for treatment and/or 
disposal.
In order to work towards the aim of carbon 
neutrality by 2030 and to ensure that we are 
mitigating the effects of waste and resource 
management on our natural environment, we 
will:
• Reuse, recycle and compost at least 
60% of municipal waste we handle by 
2030;
• Implement a kerbside collection system 
that is fully compliant with the minimum 
service standards required by the UK 
Government by 2025. This commitment 
includes:
Figure 3: A Circular Economy (Image source: 
Resources and Waste Strategy, Defra)STRATEGY 2020-30    25• Separate food waste collections to all 
eligible households by 2025, subject 
to the availability of funding from the 
Government.
• Collection of at least the core set of 
dry recyclable materials by April 2025.
• The continuation of the provision of 
separate garden waste collections 
from households.
• Increase our reuse figures by 2030 
(current rate is 0.16%).
• Landfill less than 10% of municipal 
waste by 2030.
• Work with local businesses to improve 
resource efficiency in the commercial 
sector .
• Work with our key stakeholders and 
partners to develop a new waste 
strategy for West Berkshire before 
2022.
• Continue to monitor the introduction 
of new technologies and innovations 
for future waste collections and 
management.
• Explore the ability to shred bulky 
waste and send this stream to Energy 
from Waste facilities for energy 
generation instead of landfill
• Review the potential to collect more 
plastic waste streams.
• Explore the feasibility of using 
Anaerobic Digestion for the treatment 
of separately collected food waste in 
future.
These commitments, in combination with the 
other factors outlined in this strategy , will help 
us to move towards a circular economy in 
which West Berkshire’s natural environment 
is protected and its carbon emissions are 
minimised.
6.1.5 Protecting and Enhancing our Natural 
Environment
West Berkshire has a beautiful and diverse 
natural environment. It is one of our biggest 
assets. The benefits it offers for our wildlife, our 
habitats and our health and wellbeing cannot 
be questioned. As a council, we want to work 
with others to protect and enhance it so that 
it can be used by , enjoyed, and cared for by 
everyone.
We have several existing strategies and plans 
that are relevant for protecting and enhancing the natural environment but also recognise that 
a significant amount more must be done in 
order to meet our targets. 
The UK Government’s 25 Year Environment 
Plan (25 YEP) , which we mentioned earlier in 
this strategy , provides the strategic framework 
for good environmental stewardship in 
England. At its heart is the aspiration for 
“improving the environment within a generation 
and leaving it in a better state than we found 
it”. This is an aspiration that we support 
and are looking to fulfil locally through the 
implementation of this strategy .
As with all of the measures contained in this 
strategy , this is not something the council can 
do alone. We must work with our partners to 
protect and enhance our natural environment. 
We must also use land and soils sustainably 
to ensure that they are preserved for future 
generations, deliver cleaner air and water in 
our towns and rural landscapes and protect 
threatened species and provide richer wildlife 
habitats.
Biodiversity is a key component of the natural 
world, but it is being eroded around the 
globe. Our Local Plan provides the planning 
framework for conserving and enhancing 
the natural environment in the district and 
covers the period up to 2026. More balanced 
ecosystems are more robust when faced with 
environmental changes and it is therefore 
imperative that we all as individuals and 
communities protect and preserve what we 
have currently in and around the district. The 
actions outlined later in this section will explain 
how we intend to do this.
Earlier in this strategy , we mentioned that we 
intended to undertake carbon sequestration 
measures. One of these will be a programme 
of tree and wildflower planting in our open 
spaces and on our urban highways, which will 
also add to the character and the biodiversity 
of our district. This will include:
• Schools tree planting;
• Woodland creation;
• Street tree planting and management;
• Orchard planting;
• Role of tree wardens; 
• Role of volunteers; and
• Links with the North Wessex Downs 
AONB organisation.26    STRATEGY 2020-30In terms of Public Rights of Way , we have a 
large network of approximately 1,100km of 
footpaths, byways and bridleways. We have 
a duty to assert the rights of the public to the 
use and enjoy the network. The primary aim 
of the network is to provide easy recreational 
and functional access to the countryside and 
opportunities for contact with nature.  We 
actively encourage residents and visitors to use 
these routes for health improvement purposes 
and produce a number of walking leaflets for 
this purpose. Through our delivery plan, we will 
outline how we can continue to maintain this 
and enhance it where possible.
As we have mentioned throughout this strategy , 
we are committed to protecting and enhancing 
our natural environment. In order to do so, we 
will work with partners to:
• Safeguard and enhance the beauty 
of our distinctive landscape and 
improving its environmental value 
while being sensitive to considerations 
of its heritage.
• Expand our tree planting programme 
in suitable locations across the district 
to enhance the natural environment 
and help reduce greenhouse gases 
and impurities in the atmosphere.
• Develop a Nature Recovery Plan which 
will further improve biodiversity and 
wildlife in the district.
• Encourage our residents to explore 
the natural environment, to become 
active partners in the protection and 
enhancement of biodiversity and to 
take ownership of the management of 
the natural environment.
• Apply emerging Government 
requirements for environmental 
protection and improved biodiversity 
through the planning process.
• Continue working with volunteers and 
partners to take care of the natural 
environment.
• ‘Green’ our towns by supporting the 
creation of more green zones and 
planting more urban trees.
This is by no means an exhaustive list but we 
look forward to using these projects, and others 
as new suggestions emerge, to better protect and manage our natural environment so that 
those who follow us can enjoy it and care for it 
as we have done.
6.2 How we will deliver
6.2.1 Obtaining and utilising environmental 
information
This strategy provides us with a clear vision 
and we need to consolidate key information to 
help make better environmental decisions. We 
will signpost the work of partner organisations, 
government research and any data sources 
that increase the likelihood of positive 
behaviour change on the journey to carbon 
neutrality in 2030.
We will ensure that all future proposed policy 
is aligned and supports the move towards 
carbon neutrality . We know that broader 
assessment of our environmental impact of 
our own operations, policies and projects 
is needed and that transparency will be 
key to getting communities and business to 
contribute. It is important to us that we are 
knowledgeable in the key areas and research 
is already underway , working with partners, to 
understand how all forms of effective carbon 
capture, storage and offsetting could work for 
our own activities and encourage all members 
of the community to routinely consider how 
they can do the same. We know we need to 
improve in capturing our own environmental 
information and development work to produce 
this has started. Feedback from the 2019 
Climate Conference demonstrated that this was 
important for our residents and businesses, 
they wanted to feel that we are all in this 
together .
6.2.2 Managing our own carbon budget
It is acknowledged that we must show 
ourselves as a leader in the difficult shared 
challenge of working towards carbon neutrality 
by 2030.
We will therefore review current best practice 
within the public sector and engage with sector 
specific experts to agree the boundaries of the 
organisation:
• Define the types of emissions that 
should be included;
• Understand these emissions by our 
operations;STRATEGY 2020-30    27• Provide greater certainty on how 
emission levels will change in a business 
as usual scenario; and
• Develop a series of options and actions 
for delivery of a carbon neutral Council 
by 2030. 
The accepted practice, and one that we 
will be adopting for our own footprint, is that 
when measuring, the resultant values will be 
expressed in carbon dioxide equivalents or 
CO2e. CO2e is used to express the impact of 
each different greenhouse gas in terms of the 
amount of carbon dioxide that would create 
the same amount of warming. Therefore, our 
carbon footprint will consist of lots of different 
greenhouse gases expressed as a single 
number .
Once a suitable baseline for our own emissions 
has been established, one of the first actions 
we are proposing is to introduce a series 
of ‘Carbon Budgets’ for our own activities 
and estate. For example we know that we 
consume about 11.6M kWh which if we were 
to ensure that was generated in district with 
100% renewable energy we would save just 
under 3,000 tonnes of CO2 per year , which 
demonstrates the scale of the challenge i.e. 
this is less than 0.5% of the total carbon offset 
target for West Berkshire as a whole.
The concept is to allocate an allowance of 
tonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (tCO2e) 
emissions  for each financial year . We will 
then be required to keep within this allowance 
in each of our operational areas. The CO2e 
allowance will be reduced each year in order 
to achieve carbon neutrality for the Council by 
2030.
In order to monitor performance against the 
Carbon Budgets, CO2e emissions will be 
reported annually through our Key Performance 
Indicators and published on our website.
6.2.3 Communicating with and influencing 
our stakeholders
As we have discussed in this strategy at length, 
we are not in a position to deliver our aims 
and targets in isolation. We must bring our 
community along with us and give them the 
tools and knowledge they need to take their 
own actions.As a council, we regularly consult our residents 
and our business on the policies we implement 
and seek feedback about the work we do. After 
we declared a Climate Emergency in July 2019, 
however , we decided early on that the extent of 
the challenge facing us meant that we had to 
do as much as possible to bring the public with 
us on the journey to carbon neutrality by 2030.
When we hosted the inaugural Climate 
Conference in October 2019 we took the first 
step towards this. Over 300 local people joined 
us to hear from experts, to share ideas and to 
start the conversation about what action we 
can, and must, take locally to meet our target. 
Much of what we heard at the conference 
made it clear that although carbon neutrality 
and the actions it will necessitate are likely to 
be challenging, many people locally are ready 
to play their own part. 
We will hold similar events at regular intervals in 
order to inform residents and businesses of our 
progress and the projects we are likely to be 
undertaking as well as to hear about their own 
progress, ideas and feedback.
Alongside our efforts to communicate with 
and engage our residents and businesses, we 
must also look at ways to improve accessibility 
to greener options. Much of this will be about 
ensuring that our own services, such as Waste 
and Recycling, are as low carbon and user 
friendly as possible. It will also mean we must 
aim towards having partnerships, such as with 
the Thames Valley Berkshire Local Enterprise 
Partnership, which help the community to 
access technologies and infrastructure that will 
mitigate the impact of their daily activity on the 
district’s carbon footprint. 
We will actively encourage residents, 
businesses and our partners to engage in 
carbon audits, footprint assessments and 
ongoing carbon budgeting. In doing so, we 
will encourage data sharing and best practice 
exchanges to ensure the whole of West 
Berkshire benefits from the collective effort. 
We will also explore how to use our existing 
financial models to encourage grant funding 
sensible environmental projects through, for 
example, the Community Infrastructure Levy , 
Elected Member grant bids and third party 
grants.28    STRATEGY 2020-30Our delivery plan will show how we plan to do 
this and will adapt over time as we engage 
with our residents and the impact of all of our 
actions become clearer . 
6.2.4 Working with young people
What has perhaps been most impactful both 
before and since the declaration of the Climate 
Emergency is that the district’s young people 
are engaged with this cause. It is clear that 
they feel it is their future that is most in jeopardy 
if we do not take meaningful action to address 
the effects of climate change and to protect 
our natural environment.
The interest our young people have taken 
in climate-related issued in recent years is 
unprecedented and is something that we as a 
council are keen to highlight .  The enthusiasm 
and knowledge of our young people is 
something we want to use and to develop over 
time so that the quality and scope of the local 
debate on climate change reflects the needs of 
all generations who live in West Berkshire. 
The Climate Conference in October 2019 was 
deliberately timed to take place during half 
term so that our young people could attend 
and we will continue to ensure that they are 
able to become involved with our decision 
making and our actions. We feel there are more 
possibilities to explore, linking with groups 
such as Newbury Youth Council and those 
who organised recent youth protests to find a 
platform that encourages constructive debate.
We will also, through our schools, communicate 
with them, seek their views and work with 
them to bring about the greener district they 
deserve. Embedding an understanding of 
climate change in their studies from a very 
early age will be key to this as they will be 
equipped to become custodians of our natural 
environment in the future.
6.2.5 Planning and development 
Addressing the issues and impact of industrial, 
transport and domestic carbon emissions 
requires a robust and ambitious Local Plan 
(LP) for West Berkshire. The LP sets out the 
local planning policies for West Berkshire and 
is currently going through a process of review, 
in preparation for submission to the Secretary 
of State and independent examination. Once 
adopted it will guide planning and development up to the year 2036, beyond the 2030 date 
for carbon neutrality in West Berkshire. It is 
therefore vital that we take this opportunity to 
put in place policies that will help the district 
achieve its aims.
As part of this review process we will look 
to challenge our existing policies and 
approaches, and work with local area specific 
stakeholders, to evaluate the potential for 
adoption of broader renewable technologies. 
We will also consult our peers across the 
country to determine what they are doing 
with regards to sustainable transport and 
development, and look to adopt best practice. 
We will also explore the possibility of 
including ‘allowable solutions’ which seeks 
to use financial measures e.g. Community 
Infrastructure Levy where on-site measures are 
not considered viable and instead contribute 
to a carbon sequestration/offset funds such 
as re-forestation. This is an approach that has 
been explored by other local authorities  but 
requires careful consideration in relation to 
our developing Housing Strategy and existing 
planning policies. 
On a wider point, we will lobby government 
to ensure that the National Planning Policy 
Framework and Building Regulations take into 
account the latest Climate Change scientific 
evidence, the increased public awareness and 
concern and provide us with the tools to affect 
change.
6.2.6 Nature Recovery Network
The 25 Year Environment Plan (25YEP) 
proposes the creation of a Nature Recovery 
Network26. A Nature Recovery Network is 
a joined-up system of places important for 
wild plants and animals, on land and at sea. 
It allows plants, animals, seeds, nutrients 
and water to move around more freely and 
enables the natural world to adapt to change. 
It provides plants and animals with habitats to 
live, feed and breed The Network would include 
nature reserves and local wildlife sites. It would 
also contain peat bogs, heaths, meadows and 
cliffs; road verges, parks, gardens, hedges and 
woods; and rivers, streams, ponds and lakes. 
We have recently reduced our grass and 
verges cutting frequency to aid wildlife 
establishment. The current regime is to cut 
the urban highway 8 times a years, which is 
[25]  https://www.bristol.gov .uk/documents/20182/3368102/
Carbon+Offsetting+in+the+West+of+England.pdf/894f7c11-33e4-a8b4-ec89-383828553184 
[26]  https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/sites/default/files/2018-06/Nature_recovery_network_final.pdf STRATEGY 2020-30    29already down from 10 in 2017 in most urban 
areas, this appears to be acceptable to 
the residents and keeps the majority of the 
grassed areas under control.
In more rural locations and in areas of 
open spaces, across the district there are 
opportunities to reduce this cutting regime and 
introduce space for a mix of wildflower and 
natural regeneration .
6.2.7 Working with business
Just as our residents need support to make 
responsible choices, so do our businesses. 
It is clear that businesses of all sizes in West 
Berkshire appreciate the scale of the challenge 
with respect to climate change and that they 
recognise that they too have a role to play in 
meeting it.
West Berkshire’s businesses vary in size, 
industry and scope. Across our district 
there are examples of businesses taking 
responsibility and showing leadership on this 
issue and grasping the market opportunities 
arising from a low carbon global economy . 
Our larger employers, such as Vodafone, 
AWE and Microfocus, are taking action to 
minimise their own impact through long-
established environmental corporate social 
responsibility schemes. Other West Berkshire 
businesses such as Fuel Cell Systems are at 
the forefront of developing new technology 
which will be vital to the local, and global, 
response to climate change. At the other end 
of the spectrum, innovative start-ups such as 
Thatcham Refillable are promoting choices with 
a lower environmental impact and plastic free 
living to their growing community .
The policy decisions we make and the 
infrastructure we provide should enable our 
businesses to grow in a responsible and 
sustainable way . To support this, facilities such 
as remote working, a wider range of travel 
options and access to sustainable utilities will 
be made readily available to them. Equally , the existing support offered to businesses through 
our work with the Thames Valley Berkshire 
Local Enterprise Partnership will help new and 
existing green businesses to grow and develop 
within the district.
Emerging technology and the accompanying 
infrastructure, including 5G connectivity , 
electric and autonomous vehicles and the 
Internet of Things will be integral to this. So 
too will be a transport network that helps 
employees to travel to work in sustainable 
way . Similarly , through our work on the 
education and training agenda we will give 
the workforce’s next generation the skills they 
need to thrive and carry out the green jobs 
of the future as they respond to the Climate 
Emergency . 
Not only this, but we will actively seek out 
examples of innovation or new ways of working 
among our businesses to consider whether 
these could be used in or adapted for our own 
activities. Collaborating and sharing learning 
in this way will be increasingly important in the 
coming years as we work towards this shared 
target.
Through adaptation and resilience planning 
we can reduce risks from weather related and 
safeguard business productivity , as adentified 
in the government’s risk assessment for 
business.30    STRATEGY 2020-30
Work is underway, to develop a more 
comprehensive and technically robust 
discussion on how we measure and report 
progress to work towards achieving the vision 
and the associated objectives.
We recognise, however , that this needs to 
evolve; bringing together voices from a variety 
of backgrounds and listening to experts to 
complement the work of the Council. Our first 
Climate Conference has given us valuable 
insight and we see it as a first step towards 
conducting a more open conversation with 
our community . We also recognise that future 
events must drill down into the details that 
matter in West Berkshire, with clearer links to 
the work of the council and how we can share 
our learning.It is widely acknowledged that, when it comes 
to environmental engagement, we have an 
active community which we see as a strength 
for West Berkshire. Effective and positive 
contributions from this network will be key to 
our success and every effort must be made to 
enable people be part of the solution. 
We will make sure there is ample opportunity 
for this to take place and everyone feels part of 
the conversation.
An annual report will be produced to set 
out progress against the Delivery Plan.  This 
will help to monitor the achievement of the 
objectives of this strategy and be another 
opportunity for dialogue between all those 
coming together to deliver the shared vision. 7. GovernanceSTRATEGY 2020-30    31We recognise that  the continued inclusion 
of the wider community is vital to achieving 
the aims of this strategy . Our first Climate 
Conference has given us valuable insight and 
we see it as a first step towards conducting a 
more open conversation with our community . 
We also recognise that future events must 
drill down into the details that matter in West 
Berkshire, with clearer links to the work of the

contributions from this network will be key to 
our success and every effort must be made to 
make people feel part of the solution.The vision demands a clear progress check 
on the path to carbon neutrality by 2030 
and while this is an ambitious target that 
we are determined to achieve, we have 
to acknowledge that there are a number 
of unknowns and risks in the journey 
ahead.  Chart 5 below will help guide our 
understanding on progress and gives a 
demonstration of the level of uncertainty we 
are facing.Where we identify that our projects 
are not delivering what we need, we can re-
assess and look for more effective alternatives. 
The key should be to find a balance between 
constant re-evaluation, which is resource 
intensive, and avoiding waiting until 2030 only 
to find out we didn’t do enough. To ensure 
progress is tracked we will report annually 
to full Council against the milestones in the 
Environment Delivery Plan.8. Measuring and Reporting Progress

Chart 5: Our Path to Carbon Neutrality
It is important to show an outline of the work 
we intend to do. Based on the research, 
knowledge and experience we have to 
date there are projects we believe will start 
contributing to the path we have laid out. Where we have cited numbers, these are to 
indicate scale and ambition but also a degree 
of pragmatism about delivery , this is a difficult 
balance and realise that we cannot satisfy 
everyone in what we are aiming for .32    STRATEGY 2020-308.1 Indicative projects to contribute 
towards carbon reduction targets:
• We will generate 11.5MW (equivalent 
2.018 kt CO2e)27 of renewable energy in 
the district to use for our own operations 
(equivalent to current total demand).
• We will work with partners and 
encourage residents and businesses 
to produce 20MW (equivalent 3.510 
kt CO2e) of renewable energy in the 
district to use for their own consumption.
• The number of charge points we will 
installed will significantly increase 
(actual number to be agreed on first 
strategy review).
• The number of registered Ultra Low 
Emission Vehicles (ULEV) in our fleet will 
significantly increase (actual number to 
be agreed on first strategy review).
• Carbon emissions related to our travel 
will significantly reduce (actual number 
to be agreed on first strategy review).
• The number of ULEV vehicles registered 
in the District will significantly increase 
(actual number to be agreed on first 
strategy review).
• The amount of our land converted 
to wildflower verges will significantly 
increase (A4 trial under way , feasibility 
of rolling this out to the rest of the 
District to be commissioned).
• The number of ‘impressions’ generated 
by communication projects on carbon 
reduction initiatives will significantly increase (actual number to be agreed 
on first strategy review).
8.2 Indicative projects to achieve 
energy generation and carbon 
sequestration targets:
• The Council will produce an additional 
10MW (equivalent 1.755 kt CO2e) of 
renewable energy beyond existing 
demand.
• The number of hectares of trees planted 
in the district will significantly increase.
• The number of urban tress planted will 
significantly increase (actual number to 
be agreed on first strategy review).
• Working with landowners and 
agricultural industry to investigate soil 
sequestration.
8.3  Indicative projects to improve the 
Natural Environment:
• Establish wild flower verges throughout 
West Berkshire’s highway network;
• Support and encourage community 
sequestration and carbon reduction 
initiatives;
• Investigate a joined up approach 
to natural regeneration including 
comprehensive mapping of the District 
to identify opportunities for rewilding, 
tree planting, carbon capture and 
habitat conservation and creation 
across West Berkshire. 
[27] based on forecast regional carbon intensity of 234 gCO2/kWh https://carbonintensity .org.uk/ STRATEGY 2020 -30    33Climate change is an internationally recognised 
challenge and we need to play our part in 
addressing it. As a result we are aiming for 
carbon neutrality in West Berkshire by 2030.
The Council’s declaration of a Climate 
Emergency in July 2019 was an important 
marker . It was a commitment to leading efforts 
to mitigate the impact of climate change locally , 
and to bring our residents, businesses and 
communities along with us.
We are under no illusions about the level of 
ambition this will require. The changes to our 
lifestyles, to our use of resources and to the 
way in which we deliver our services will be 
extensive. We recognise, however , that this 
must be done. This Council is ready to make 
these changes and to assist others in our 
district to do the same.
The projects we have alluded to in this strategy 
will address the impact man-made climate 
change is having on our environment. We will 
use our delivery plan to manage these projects, 
to track their progress and to measure their 
impact. 
Measuring this impact will be fundamental as 
we embark on the journey towards carbon 
neutrality . In order to do so, we have developed 
a number of key performance indicators (KPIs) 
which we will use alongside the emissions 
figures that national government publishes 
annually . This will allow us to transparently 
show where things are going well and where 
more needs to be done to keep us on track.Over the lifetime of this strategy there are 
likely to be a number of developments which 
will affect our ability to achieve our target.   
Some will have a positive impact, some a 
negative one. Equally , some will be within our 
control while others are outside of it. We don’t 
currently have detailed answers for getting 
all the way to our target.   Regardless of what 
happens, however , we must ensure that we are 
able to respond both proactively and reactively . 
We are confident that the work we have done 
already and the commitments we have made 
in this strategy are the right ones but it is also 
important for us to recognise that the impacts 
of climate change are wide-ranging and not 
entirely predictable. For this reason, we will 
track our progress and monitor developments 
where they affect this strategy .
Working towards this ambition will require us 
to be creative, determined, and to make use of 
emerging technology . Most importantly of all, 
however , it will require everyone in the district to 
take responsibility for the impact their choices 
have on the environment. 9. Conclusions34    STRATEGY 2020-30What has been achieved since the Council unanimously declared a 
climate emergency on 2nd July 2019?
As well as developing this Environment Strategy , there have been other actions and changes being 
made to work towards reducing carbon and enhancing our environment in West Berkshire.  Whilst by 
no means an exhaustive list, a flavour of what has been achieved since the declaration of a climate 
emergency in July 2019 is set out below. 
Projects
• Delivered the A4 wild flower verges project.
• Launched the UK’s first Community Municipal Investment - an opportunity to invest directly in a 
greener future for the district. 
• Installed solar photovoltaic panels to the first phase of Council buildings in order to generate and 
use sustainable energy 
• Undertaken a carbon audit of the Council to establish the Council’s current carbon footprint
Engagement / information 
• Held a successful Climate Conference with over 300 people in attendance  
• Wide ranging consultation on a draft Environment Strategy through an online survey , community 
conversations with Parish Councils, interested groups and individuals, drop-in sessions at 
selected District libraries and direct responses and representations.
• Set up a new Environment Delivery Team within the Environment Department at the Council to 
support the work on delivering this Environment Strategy .
Infrastructure
• Progressed the West Berkshire sections of the new National Cycle Network Route 422.
• Completed the Hermitage to Hampstead Norreys foot/cycle link.
• Successfully bid for our full emergency active travel fund allocation.
• Commissioning of 18 on street electric charge points (in addition to the 18 commissioned early 
2019).
• Increased the percentage of fully electric vehicles in the Council’s fleet from 10% to 20%.
• Introduced an Intelligent Traffic Signal system on the A4 in Thatcham to reduce congestion and 
improve air quality .
• Continued with the LED replacement of street lighting units (96.13% of total stock).
• Increased our use of recycled materials in road construction (e.g. In our road re-surfacing 
programme all sites now use asphalts with an increased percentage of recycled material 
content; Use of recycled rubber speed cushions in Turnpike Road, Newbury).
• Completion of the Dunstan Park and South East Thatcham Flood Alleviation scheme protecting 
573 properties from the effects of climate change.
• Increased use of warm asphalts and cold lay recycled asphalts in surfacing works.  This 
provides a significant reduction in CO2 in its production and use.  As much as 25kg of CO2 can 
be saved per tonne of material when used in place of hot mix materials.
• Implemented a more efficient way of identifying areas of carriageway repair in order to reduce 
waste.
• Purchasing products for particular projects from local suppliers to reduce CO2 delivery

Abbreviation Term Explanation
 Anaerobic Digestion A process in which organic matter is broken 
down by micro-organisms in an oxygen free 
‘tank’ to produce fuels.
AONB Area of Outstanding Natural 
BeautyArea of countryside designated for 
conservation in recognition of its national 
importance.
 Baseline A fixed point of reference used as a starting 
point for comparison purposes.
 Biodiversity The variety of plant and animal life.
 Carbon budget The maximum amount of greenhouse gases 
that can be emitted over a certain period.
 CCS Carbon capture and storage Trapping carbon at its emission source, and 
then storing it long term.
CO2e Carbon Dioxide Equivalent A term used to describe different 
greenhouse gases in a common unit. For any 
greenhouse gases and their amount, it is the 
amount of carbon dioxide which would have 
the equivalent warming impact.
 Carbon footprint/carbon audit The total greenhouse gas emissions caused 
by a person/event/organisation/product, 
expressed as the carbon dioxide equivalent.
 Carbon neutral/ carbon 
neutralityThe act of reducing a person’s/events/
organisations/products carbon footprint to 
zero through energy efficiency measures and 
external emission reductions projects.
 Climate change The long-term shift in the planets weather 
patterns and temperatures.
 CCA Climate Change Act 2008 Provides the framework for the UK’s climate 
change policy
 Climate Change Bonds Fixed income bonds, linked to climate 
change solutions.
 Climate Emergency Declaration The Declarations vary for each organisation. 
The Council’s Declaration is set out in the 
Introduction section of the Environment 
Strategy .
 CO2 emissions within the 
scope of influence of Local 
AuthoritiesThe UK produces a breakdown of carbon 
dioxide emissions by Local Authority area 
as a subset of its annual inventory of 
greenhouse gas emissions. The emissions 
deemed to be within the scope of Local 
Authorities exclude large industrial sites, 
railways, motorways and land-use.36    STRATEGY 2020-30CCC Committee on Climate Change Independent body to advise the government 
on climate change.
CIL Community Infrastructure Levy A charge which can be levied on new 
developments within the Local Authority’s 
area. It helps deliver required infrastructure.
 Delivery Plan  The Council’s plan on how the objectives of 
the Environment Strategy will be achieved.
 Economic Development Board Newly formed Economic Board which will 
oversee the Economic Development Strategy , 
implementing an action plan to fulfil its 
objectives.
EU ETS European Union Emissions 
Trading SystemThe first and largest greenhouse gas 
emissions trading system in the world. 
It works on a ‘cap and trade’ principle 
where allowances are set. Allowances are 
auctioned off or allocated for free. Emitters 
must ensure they have enough allowances 
to meet their emissions or purchase more. 
Those who reduce their emissions and have 
spare allowances can sell off their credits.
 Green energy Definitions would usually mean the gas 
or electricity were from 100% renewable 
sources. 
GHG Greenhouse gases Gases in the atmosphere that absorb and re-
emit heat. They occur naturally in the Earth’s 
atmosphere but human activity increases 
these, leading to increased warming and 
climate change.
