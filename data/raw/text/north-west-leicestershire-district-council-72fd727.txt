Why we must act  
 
 
 
The science is clear: our climate is changing 
and urgent efforts are required to accelerate 
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  
 
In June 2019, the UK committed to net zero 
carbon emissions by 2050 and North West 
Leicestershire District Council has declared a 
climate emergency.  
 
Society ha s become more active about it and 
there are important voices calling for 
immediate action.

A clear national consensus  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  “Reaching net zero carbon emissions by 
2050 is achievable. However, this requires 
immediate  action  across all key 
technologies and policy areas.”  
 
National Grid   
(Future Energy Scenarios, July 2019 ) “Delivery of greenhouse gas reductions 
must progress with far greater  urgency .” 
 
Committee on Climate Change  
(Net Zero Report, May  2019  
“It is still not too late to act. It will take a 
far-reaching vision, it will take courage , it 
will take fierce, fierce determination to act 
now, to lay the foundations where we may 
not know all the details about how to 
shape the ceiling. In other words, it  will 
take cathedral thinking. ”  
  
Greta Thunberg  
 “If we don't take action, the collapse of our 
civili sations and the extinction of much of 
the natural world is on the horizon .”

Greenhouse gases , air pollution  and fuel poverty  
 
Greenhouse gases  emitted in NWL are generally bulk products of the combustion of fossil fuels . They are produced on a 
massive scale. It is not practical to separate, remove or store these gases therefore our primary means to reduce them is 
to burn less fuel. Historically, this has been achieved through making vehicles, buildings and electricity generators more 
efficient. Efficiency alone cannot deliver zero carbon.  
 
Zero emission technologies such as wind turbines, solar panels, heat pump s and electric cars can generate electricity, 
heat and provide transportation without any need for fossil fuels. They offer a plausible route to achieve net zero 
emissions of greenhouse gases.  
 
Air pollution  is often also caused by  the combustion of fossil  fuels, however it is usually due to very small quantities of 
pollutants that are produced as by -products. These can often be filtered to some extent, such as through the use of 
catalytic converters in vehicles.  
 
Fuel poverty  is caused by excessive need fo r energy and/or excessive cost of energy, relative to income. This is often due 
to people on lower incomes living in inefficient housing, driving inefficient vehicles and/or being charged higher rates for 
energy.  
 
This report  focuses solely on the measures  required to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in North West 
Leicestershire. It is important to understand that many, but not all, of these measures will also help to reduce air 
pollution and fuel poverty.

North West Leicestershire: Business as Usual vs Zero Carbon  2050  
 
Greenhouse gas emissions for North West Leicestershire showing the 
‘carbon gap’ between business as usual and net zero carbon.  
 
 
 Emissions  from North West Leicestershire  
have fallen significantly due to the 
replacement of coal and gas fired -electricity 
generation with wind turbines and solar 
panels across the UK.  
 
Buildings and transport now need to see 
major reductions, together with an increase 
in forested areas to achieve net zero 
emissions.  
 
There is a significant ‘carbon gap ’ between 
the current trajectory and net zero . Changes 
to policy and markets  will be necessary to 
eliminate this.  The sooner emissions are 
reduced, the greater the reduction in total 
emissions.

Target trajectory
Many indirect emissions that occur during the extraction, processing, manufacture and transport 
of products and services outside North West Leicestershire, are not considered in this report. 
These can only be reduce d through reducing consumption, or international decarbonisation of the 
supply chain for these products.

NWL District Council: Current greenhouse gas emissions and influence  
 
Total greenhouse gas emissions from North West Leicestershire in 
2016 by influence of NWLDC  
 
  
 
 
Direct emissions from NWLDC are less than 1.7%  of 
total emissions from the district  (Council buildings and 
homes, vehicle fleet) . 
 
The Council can directly influence a further 32%  of 
emissions.  
 
The m ain opportunities for direct influence are:  
 Planning for new buildings  
 Planning control for new industrial installations and 
site emissions  
 Electric transport infrastructure  
 Waste reduction an d diversion from landfill

Decarbonisation of electricity: A success story  
 
UK greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation 
have dropped massively and wil l continue to fall. NWL has a 
responsibility to do its part.  
 
Average  carbon intensity associated with generating each unit,  
or kWh, of electricity in the UK since  1970.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
North West Leicestershire is currently performing very 
well in terms of solar PV generation . Solar generation is 
equal to 14% of the district’s electricity consumption. The 
national average is just 4%.

Making Council buildings more energy efficient  
 
 
 
The Council’s offices have an ‘E’ energy rating (DEC) and emit 180 
tonnes of carbon a year. A similar refurbished building with heat pumps 
and solar panels would be able to reduce this by approximately 80% . 
 
 Recommendations for domestic buildings  
 Integrate m easures towards full retrofit or 
demolition and rebuild  with maintenance and 
improvement schedules over a five -year period.  
 Build new Council homes to the Passivhaus or an 
equivalent ‘best practice’ energy performance 
standard.  
 
 
Recommendations for non -domestic buildings  
 Develop a retrofit fit plan  to align the new leisure 
centre with the Council’s zero carbon aims.  
 Survey and prepare a full retrofit plan for the 
Council offices to deliver a  zero carbon 
refurbishment over 10 -year period.  
 Prepare a p rocess for assess ing and retrofit ting  
Council owned  assets  that reach end of lease.

Decarbonis ation  of heat : the new  priority  
 
Fossil fuels cannot be used for heating 
buildings if the UK or NWL are to achieve net 
zero carbon targets.  
 
Installation of gas boilers in North West 
Leicester shire should cease from 2020. Low 
carbon alternatives such as heat pumps should 
be installed in new and  existing buildings.  
   
Do you expect heat pumps to become the main 
solution for heating in the future?

Decarbonisation of transport: Electrification  
 
 
Greenhouse gas emissions from th e Council’s vehicle fleet, 
including refuse  and recycling vehicles  could become close to net 
zero  through phased replacement with an electric fleet . This will 
deliver immediate emission reductions, with emissions continuing 
to fall as the UK’s electricity supply decarbonises.  
 
 
 Pool cars should be  changed at the next replacement cycle  
 Housing/ground maintenance vehicles should also change as 
soon as possible  
 Waste trucks should change once viable electric options are 
available.  
 
The Council could play a significant role in e nabling electrification 
of the district as a whole by developing a strategy to roll out 
charging points for all users of electric vehicles.

Waste : Towards a circular economy  
 
In 2017 NWLDC achieved a recycling rate of 45.7%.  
 
Waste will increasingly need to be considered as a high -value 
resource, where waste  volumes are diminished and high re -
use and recycling rates are the norm.  Recycling should result 
in useful non -polluting inputs or re -purposed high -quality 
materials.  
 
The Council have introduced the Recycle more campaign in 2019. This sets a 
target recy cling rate of 50% by 2022 and introduces a number of initiatives to 
support this aim.  
 
 
 
 
 
   
Beyond 2025 the district will need to focus on moving 
beyond recycling to reduce total volumes through zero 
waste supply chains and encouraging development of 
a circular economy.  
 
Proposed new targets  
 
2020   Permanent food waste recycling across 
the district.  
 
2022   50% recycling rate  
 
2023  Introduce food waste recycling to 
businesses  
 
2025   70% recycling rate  
 
2025  20% reduction in fo od waste  
 
2025   Zero organic waste to landfill

Forestry, land -use and agriculture  
 
Forestry, land -use and agriculture accounts for 9% of greenhouse gas emissions in NWL. The actions summarised below 
have multiple cross -sector benefits, including public health.  
 
 
Plant more trees & restore land       Dietary change: more plants, less meat  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Improve agricultural processes   
 
 
  
Aim to triple the current 4,481 hectares of 
woodland . Restore heathland, peatland, grassland 
and wetlands.  
 Engage with the public and businesses to increase 
consumption of plants and reduce consumption of 
meat and dairy.  
 
Incorporate this change within the Council.  
 Engage with farmers to better understand 
how NWLDC can support them to implement 
better agricultural practices.

Medium and long -term actions  
 
A comprehensive range of actions is 
required in order to achieve Net Zero 
Carbon.  
 
We have broken them down by action areas 
and prepared a list of actions that the 
District Council can review, adjust and 
make their own.

Two Action Plans  
 
Power  
 
3y Renewable energy for Council buildings  
Instal l PVs on the Council’s non -domestic buildings, starting with the largest roof areas: the Council’s Offices and 
the Ashby Leisure Centre  
 
Buildings  and towns  
 
3y Start retrofitting existing housing owned by the Council  
Building energy efficiency  (insulation, improved airtightness and better windows ), better ventilation (MVHR 
wherever possible), retrofit heat pumps and install PVs  
Target high emission homes first (e.g. those using coal or oil).  
Undertake a pilot project/exemplar to establish costs and programme requirements for wider roll out.  
 
Transport  
 
3y Use  electric vans  
Start the process of replacing the Council’s 65 vans with EV vans  
 
Waste  
 
3y Target a 70% recycling rate for waste from all council buildings by 2021  
 
 
 
  We have  also identified a number 
of decisive actions for the next 
three years which would put 
North West Leicestershire District 
Council on the right track to 
achieve:  
 a Net Zero Council by 2030.  
 a Net Zero District by 2050.  
 
If implemented, the Council would 
lead by example.  
 
Here are some examples of 
actions.

Achieving Zero Carbon for the Council by 2030  
 
Greenhouse gas emissions for NW Leicestershire District Council in 
2017 and potential net zero emissions for 2030  
 
 
 
 
 
  
A Zero Carbon Council is possible, but requires 
a step change in investment.  
 
Improvements to Council owned homes and 
non -domestic buildings is the biggest 
change required . 80% of dwellings are 
assumed to have a whole house refurbishment 
by 2030.  
 
All Co uncil buildings should be moved to low 
carbon heating provided by  heat pumps . 
 
Remaining additional generation or offset by 
the council is 2,300  tCO 2e. This would require 
planting 110-440 hectares of woodland to 
achieve Net Zero .

Achieving Zero Carbon for  North West Leicestershire by 2050  
 
Greenhouse gas emission history and projection for NW Leicestershire 
District showing scenario for getting to net zero carbon by 2050 and 
contribution of current technologies  
 
  
 
Significant contributions from buildings , 
transport and industry are needed to meet 
zero carbon targets.  
 
There is still some gap between what can 
be met with current technology and zero 
carbon. Even with a doubling of current 
woodland area, new  technology is 
required at a national level, for example 
Carbon Capture and Storage.  
 
The earlier action is taken the faster the 
target can be achieved.
