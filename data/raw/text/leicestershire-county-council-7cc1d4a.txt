2020-2024
This document suppo rts the Leicestershire County Council Envir onment Strategy 2018-2030: 
Delivering a better future.
Introduction
This Action Plan is a living document which is being added to and chanaged as new projects and new information becomes available. 
It is reviewed at least once a year as part of an annual refresh.
The Action plan contains all currently known active and planned actions being carried out by LCC and or partners that contrib uteto 
the delivery of the aims and objectives of the Environment Strategy 2018 -2030.
The Scope column refers to where the source of the environmental aspect lies and / or where the benefit of the action will si t. For 
example in the case of carbon emissions 'internal' refers to LCC's emissions and 'external' refers to Leicestershire's emissi ons. In the 
case of waste, household waste is treated as' external' while LCC's office waste is treated as 'internal'. Where there is bot h an 
internal and external aspect or benefit it is categorised as 'both'.
The Action Plan sets out the project lead for each action and the key partners in supporting delivery of the action.
The currently known timescales are set out and also which of the objectives of the Envrionment Strategy the action is expecte d to 
mainly support, as referenced in the Environment Policy section of the Environment Strategy 2018 -2030.
The actions and timescales will be reviewed and updated as necessary to take account of the Coronavirus pandemic. 
This high level Action Plan is supported by more detailed project plans as appropriate.Scope
