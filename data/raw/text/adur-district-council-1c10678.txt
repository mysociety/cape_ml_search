DRAFT CLIMATE PLAN FOR ADUR & WORTHING
 
 
 
Introduction
 
 
This
​
Draft
Climate
Plan
​
takes
the
incredible
amount
of
energy
and
ideas
from
the
Zero
2030
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conference and distils them into our aims, ambitions and actions.
 
 
 
The
aims
are
overarching
goals
–
targets
we
need
to
strive
towards
when
taking
action
to
reduce
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adur
and
Worthing’s
climate
and
ecological
footprint.
We
need
to
aim
towards
zero
carbon
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
emissions
by
2030
and
see
a
dramatic
increase
in
the
number
of
plants,
insects
and
animals
we
see
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in our towns.
 
 
 
We
have
listed
many
of
the
projects,
programmes
and
organisations,
all
of
whom
are
working
hard
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
create
positive
changes
and
improve
our
environment.
Where
possible,
we
want
to
support
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
grow these projects, who already deliver on so many of the actions we need.
 
 
 
Our
action
points
are
strategic
–
this
means
they
are
not
detailed
but
they
provide
a
direction
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
travel
to
achieve
our
aims.
This
will
allow
the
variety
of
groups
and
organisations
to
use
this
action
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
plan
when
going
for
funding
or
building
partnerships,
seeing
what
actions
their
projects
fit
to
or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
expand
upon.
By
working
to
this
action
plan,
we
can
ensure
that
the
variety
of
projects
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
programmes move in the same direction, towards zero carbon whilst growing biodiversity.
 
 
Adur
and
Worthing
have
a
wealth
of
talent,
enthusiasm
and
dedicated
people,
groups
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
organisations
who
understand
the
urgency
and
necessity
for
change.
By
working
together,
building
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
new
networks
and
partnerships
and
promoting
projects
widely,
we
can
harness
this
energy
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
focus results.
 
 
 
Many
of
the
themes
and
their
action
points
are
cross-cutting
and
related.
For
example,
a
project
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
limit
flooding
in
a
particular
street,
might
also
have
wildlife
benefits
and
in
turn
benefits
to
residents,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
through
a
more
beautiful
place
to
live.
This
is
to
be
expected
and
embraced;
projects
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
programmes
which
deliver
multiple
benefits
for
more
people
are
likely
more
sustainable
in
the
long
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
run.
 
 
 
The
solutions
for
climate
change
and
the
ecological
crisis
cover
all
levels
of
governance,
from
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
United
Nations
and
central
Government
to
our
individual
lives.
We
must
push
for
top-level
change,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
whilst
building
local
adaptation
and
mitigation,
making
the
necessary
reductions
on
our
collective
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
carbon
emissions
and
ecological
footprints.
Both
strategies
are
needed,
and
we
will
encourage
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
support all action that achieves these aims.
 
 
 
Adur
&
Worthing
Councils
(AWC)
have
produced
their
own,
internal
action
plan,

.
This
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Climate
Action
Plan
is
for
everyone
in
our
area
–
it
will
take
all
our
efforts
to
achieve
rapid
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
positive
changes.
By
working
together,
Adur
and
Worthing
residents,
visitors,
businesses
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
services, can forge a greener, cleaner and healthier environment for us to live, work and play.

was
declared
a
Local
Nature
Reserve
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(LNR).
This
is
due
to
its
vegetated

which
is
rare
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
worldwide.

committed
to

encouraging

and implementing wilding and tree planting programmes.
 
 
 
What Needs to Happen Next:
 
 
●
Create
more
spaces
where
wildlife
can
thrive
and
connect
these
spaces
across
our
towns
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
planting
more
trees,
wildflowers
and
wild
areas,
allowing
species
to
move
throughout
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
urban environments more safely.
 
 
●
Make
sure
nature-based
solutions
for
climate
change
are
considered
by
decision-makers
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
when planning for our future.
 
 
●
Promote
the
range
of
benefits
associated
with
gardening
for
wildlife,
encouraging
more
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
people to make spaces in their gardens and streets for nature.
 
●
Inspire
and
educate
children
and
adults
in
the
joy
of
nature,
building
communities
who
care
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
about the wildlife living on our doorsteps.
 
 
●
Ensure
that
activities
and
action
is
coordinated
across
Adur
and
Worthing,
to
better
promote
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
projects,
encourage
more
people
to
get
involved
and
maximise
the
opportunities
for
wildlife
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to thrive.
 
  
We
have
just
experienced
a
drastic
change
to
our
lives,
during
the
coronavirus
crisis.
For
those
of
us
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
who
were
not
directly
affected,
we
were
lucky
to
benefit
from
a
glorious
spring.
Many
people
have
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
discovered
a
newfound
urge
to
encourage
nature,
grow
their
own
food
and
enjoy
their
local
green
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
spaces.
Our
volunteer
groups
have
reported
an
uplift
in
people
who
want
to
get
involved
growing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and championing green spaces and our wildlife.
 
 
By
harnessing
this
energy
and
joining
our
efforts
up,
we
can
work
towards
achieving
more
wild
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
natural
spaces.
Even
the
humble
Dandelion
can
support
many
different
types
of
insects
and
provide
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
‘puddles
of
sunshine’
for
us
on
concrete
pavements.
We
can
stop
the
disappearance
of
species
from
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
our urban environments and create places buzzing with lots of little lives.
 
 
In
2030
we
want
to
see
a
return
of
many
of
our
beloved
species
into
our
gardens
and
parks,
with
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enjoyment
of
watching
and
experiencing
our
living
world,
on
our
doorsteps
and
our
wide
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
environment, shared by children and adults alike.
 
 
 
 
 
CLIMATE RESILIENCE
 
 
Our
aim
is
that
Adur
and
Worthing
is
able
to
cope
with
changes
to
our
weather
systems,
including
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hotter,
drier
summers,
with
predicted
heatwaves,
droughts,
and
wetter
winters,
with
greater
risks
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
flooding.

and the development of rain gardens, to slow excess rainfall.
 
 
Tree planting projects
 
Various
groups
and
organisations
are
working
to

important habitat and protecting water sources from pollution.
 
 
 
What Needs to Happen Next:
 
 
 ●
Work
with
AWC
and
other
partners
to
support
public
and
private
realm
interventions
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reduce
the
impact
of
heating
and
flooding,
for
example
small-scale
SUDS
around
our
towns
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that can be used as learning opportunities.
 
●
Support
existing
groups
and
projects
to
widen
their
reach
and
impact
and
share
good
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
practice,
building
upon
​
S u s t a i n a b l e A W
magazine
and
using
social
media
and
local
networks
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to widen our scope.
 
●
Develop
a
‘Climate
Resilience
Fund’
for
local
community
organisations
to
access,
enabling
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their work to become sustainable by covering some core cost funding annually.
 
●
Educate
and
empower
our
community
to
take
action
in
their
individual
lives
and
understand
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the impact that our choices make on the environment.
 
●
Build
upon
the
local
mutual
aid
networks
to
create
neighbourhood
resilience,
helping
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
neighbours
to
watch
out
for
vulnerable
members
of
their
communities,
sharing
resources
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and create caring communities.
 
 
 
We
build
resilience
by
forming
networks
and
partnerships,
be
that
with
our
friends,
neighbours
or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
through
collaborations
with
other
organisations.
In
our
towns
and
cities,
climate
resilience
will
mean
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
protecting
the
ability
of
our
services
to
run
during
extreme
weather
events,
most
likely
drought
or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
flooding
in
our
area.
Resilience
will
also
mean
creating
local
food
security
and
ensuring
our
residents
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have access to resources during this transition, the skills to repair and share effectively.
 
 
 
Already
we
have
a
wealth
of
examples
where
resilience
is
being
delivered,
through
rain
gardens
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
household
improvements,
to
natural
flood
management
and
emergency
planning
for
essential
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
services.
The
groups
and
networks
which
already
exist
are
themselves
great
examples
of
community
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collaborations,
ideas
in
action
and
inspiring
stories.
As
we
expand
local
digital
capacity,
we
can
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
innovate working practices and rethink our public realm.
 
 
In
2030
our
vision
is
that
Adur
and
Worthing
have
happy,
healthy
residents,
who
can
feel
confident
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
their
water,
food
and
energy
supplies
will
continue
to
work
during
challenging
times.
Our
towns
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will
be
places
where
businesses
and
visitors
generate
a
vibrant
local
economy,
with
buildings,
streets
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and estates prepared for predicted shifts to our weather and coastline.
 
 
 
 
 
CARBON REDUCTION
 
 
 
Our
aim
is
for
Adur
and
Worthing
to
have
reduced
its
carbon
emissions
to
zero;
with
homes
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
businesses
using
renewable
technologies
for
heating
and
energy,
people
choosing
active
travel
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
waste now used within a circular economy.

What Needs to Happen Next:
 
 
 
●
Educate
and
promote
widely
the
importance
of
understanding
our
own
personal,
household
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
organisational
carbon
footprint,
including
understanding
how
carbon
is
embedded
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the things we buy and use, and what steps we can take to reduce these footprints.
 
●
Support
ecological
projects
that
help
sequester
carbon,
such
as
changing
farming
practices,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
planting
trees,
enhancing
chalk
grassland
and
saltmarsh,
or
returning
kelp
forests
to
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shores.
 
 
●
Build
on
the
Eco
Open
Houses
project
and
develop
an
Adur
and
Worthing
network
of
case
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
studies,
showing
the
costs
and
reductions
in
energy
bills
and
carbon
which
can
be
achieved
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by households and business.
 
●
Break
the
chains
of
fossil
fuel
use
and
investment
by
transforming
our
energy
supplies,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reducing energy demand, lobbying for divestment, and consuming more wisely.
 
●
Work
with
communities
and
people
who
need
extra
support
to
improve
their
homes,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
making them warm and reducing their energy bills.
 
 
●
Support
the
public,
business
and
industrial
sectors
to
reduce
carbon
through
sharing
good
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
practice, promoting funding opportunities and developing local case studies
 
 
Reducing
carbon
is
another
theme
which
links
to
many
others.
Everything
we
do,
use
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
throwaway
has
a
carbon
footprint.
The
main
source
of
carbon
generated
in
Adur
and
Worthing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
comes
from
our
household
energy
use,
when
we
cook,
heat,
light
our
homes
and
entertain
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ourselves.
This
use
also
applies
to
business
and
industrial
buildings,
adding
to
our
areas
overall
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
carbon footprint. Transport and waste make up the remaining bulk of emissions.
 
We
can
reduce
our
energy
demand
by
insulating
our
homes
and
choosing
efficient
appliances
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
goods.
We
can
choose
to
install
renewable
technologies
or
use
green
energy
suppliers,
walk
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cycle
more,
work
from
home
and
reduce
the
amount
of
waste
we
send
to
landfill.
We
can
eat
local
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
seasonal
food
produce,
from
farms
that
respect
soils
and
nature.
We
can
learn
to
recognise
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
casual
consumption,
choosing
to
enjoy
community,
culture
and
experiences
over
fast
fashion,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
short-lived
gadgets
or
the
latest
fads.
All
these
choices
will
reduce
our
carbon
load
and
when
taken
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
together will make significant reductions.
 
 
Our
aim
by
2030
is
to
have
communities,
organisations
and
businesses
who
understand
and
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
actively
reducing
their
carbon
footprints
towards
net
zero.
We
will
have
secured
investment
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
built networks and partnerships to support our areas ambitions.

through
energy

and
improved

powered
by
affordable,
renewable
energy,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
minimising
carbon
emissions
and
having
efficient,
futureproofed

to
keep
our
towns
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
running.

What Needs to Happen Next:
 
 
 
●
Expand
the
Solar
Schools
programme,
ensuring
all
local
schools
benefit
from
significant
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
short-term
reductions
in
energy
costs,
with
free
longer-term
energy
and
using
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
installations as learning opportunities for their pupils and parents.
 
 
●
Build
capacity
through
training
and
networking
for
local
builders
and
boiler
installers
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
effectively
support
the
installation
of
non-gas
heating
and
cooking
options,
and
promoting
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
government financial incentives for these systems.
 
 ●
Widely
promote
Government
grants
and
the
benefits
of
installing
renewable
energy
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
technologies,
home
insulation
and
the
savings
gained,
aiming
to
monitor
progress
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
installations are delivered.
 
 
●
Significantly expand renewable energy generation throughout Adur and Worthing
 
●
Reduce
fossil
fuel
energy
use
through
insulation,
energy
efficiency
and
efficient
services
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
programmes for all sectors
 
 
How
we
heat,
light,
cook
and
use
technology,
both
at
work
and
home,
must
change
significantly
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
meet
our
commitments
under
the
Paris
Agreement.
We
need
to
move
away
from
energy
that
comes
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, to using solar, wind and heat from the air or ground.
 
 
 
There
are
several
financial
initiatives
to
support
the
change
to
these
systems
for
domestic
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
non-domestic
energy
use.
We
need
to
make
more
of
these
and
build
local
capacity,
creating
jobs
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fulfil
our
needs.
This
presents
great
opportunities
for
our
towns
by
creating
skilled
jobs,
reducing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
energy
costs
for
everyone
and
bringing
investment.
We
need
to
manage
energy
capacity
locally
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
improve community energy storage.
 
 
By 2030 our energy must be delivered to homes and businesses without the use of fossil fuels.
 
 
 
 
 
 
WATER
 
 
Our
aim
is
for
Adur
and
Worthing

with
water
captured
and

What Needs to Happen Next:
 
 
 
●
Implement
Sustainable
Urban
Drainage
systems
(SUDs),
visibly
throughout
Adur
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Worthing,
using
these
as
educational
tools
and
encouraging
greater
take
up
by
homeowners
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and business.
 
●
Encourage
greater
uptake
of
water
saving
measures
through
promoting
more
widely
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
activities
undertaken
by
Eco
Open
Houses
participants
and
Southern
Water
customer
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
programmes.
 
●
Reduce
the
amount
of
waste
and
rubbish
which
enters
our
streams,
rivers
and
the
sea
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
encouraging
active
participation
of
regular
litter
picks
and
making
dropping
rubbish
or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
discharging waste to water sources unacceptable.
 
 
●
Support
homes
and
businesses
in
the
collection
of
rainwater,
for
use
in
gardens
and
green
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
spaces, or in the longer term to supplement water use within buildings.
 
 
●
Monitor
and
evaluate
water
quality
in
rivers
and
our
seas
by
developing
citizen
science
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
projects and supporting annual monitoring beach cleans.
 
 
 
We
often
take
water
for
granted;
we
turn
on
the
tap
and
out
it
comes.
Increasingly,
our
water
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
supplies
will
be
affected
by
drought
conditions
during
summer
periods
and
flooding
will
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exacerbated
during
the
winter
months.
Our
towns
are
identified
as
being
within
‘water
stressed’
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
areas.
To
protect
ourselves
against
extreme
weather
events,
we
need
to
look
carefully
at
our
public
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
spaces,
putting
in
measures
to
reduce
flood
risks
and
capturing
water
to
use
in
our
gardens.
These
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
measures
might
take
the
form
of
rain
gardens,
sustainable
urban
drainage
systems
(SUDs)
or
water
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
butts.
 
 
 
The
quality
of
our
water
will
be
improved
by
less
discharge
into
water
supplies
from
industrial
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
processes
or
from
farms,
and
a
reduction
in
the
amount
of
litter
reaching
our
rivers
and
seas.
We
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
can
all
play
our
part
in
this
by
taking
rubbish
home
or
joining
any
number
of
the
litter
picks
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
already take place across our area.
 
 
 
In
2030
we
need
to
be
collecting
and
storing
water,
reducing
the
flow
into
our
drains
by
slowing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rainfall
through
our
environments
and
keeping
our
waters
clean
and
clear.
Our
rivers
and
sea
will
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
good
quality,
supporting
wildlife
and
providing
beautiful
places
for
the
enjoyment
of
residents,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
visitors and wildlife.
 
 
 
 
 
 
TRANSPORT
 
 
Our
aim
is
for
Adur
and
Worthing
to
be
a
place
where
people
feel
safe
and
secure
to
walk
or

What Needs to Happen Next:
 
 
 
●
Support
the
expansion
of
high
quality,
well
used
cycle
infrastructure
for
Adur
&
Worthing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enabling
a
preferred
choice
of
cycling
over
car
use
especially
for
shorter
journeys
across
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adur and Worthing.
 
 
●
Build
partnerships
between
transport
providers
and
community
organisations
to
promote
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
public
transport
whilst
they
move
towards
zero-carbon
targets,
for
example
by
having
all
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
buses running fully electric.
 
●
Enable
mass
bicycle
events,
cycle
training
for
adults
and
children,
walking
trains
to
school,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Schools Streets and active travel plans for businesses and organisations.
 
●
Support
the
monitoring
of
air
pollution
and
idling
by
community
organisations,
widely
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
promoting
the
results,
the
effects
of
air
pollution
on
health
and
the
benefits
of
changing
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
behaviours.
 
●
Seek
to
reduce
the
numbers
of
cars
needed
by
communities,
encouraging
the
development
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
car
sharing
schemes,
such
as
car
clubs
or
lift
share
schemes
for
businesses,
explore
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
technology and innovation to drive uptake and ease of access.
 
 
 
Transport
which
uses
fossil
fuels,
petrol
or
diesel
cars,
vans
and
lorries,
is
the
third
largest
source
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
carbon
emissions
in
Adur
and
Worthing.
It
also
causes
air
pollution,
which
is
now
being
linked
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 more
and
more
physical
health
conditions
and
may
also
impact
mental
health.
By
moving
away
from
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transport fuelled by fossil fuels, we will be gaining many benefits throughout our towns.
 
 
 
During
the
coronavirus
crisis
we
saw
a
huge
increase
in
the
number
of
people
able
to
work
from
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
home,
with
many
reporting
a
better
work-life
balance
because
of
it.
People
also
dusted
off
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bikes
and
used
the
empty
streets
to
travel
more
efficiently,
improving
their
health
and
taking
more
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interest
in
their
local
environments.
The
Government
wants
there
to
be
a
renaissance
of
cycling
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
across
the
country
and
has
provided
grants
to
all
councils
to
implement
better
cycling
infrastructure.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If
we
can
support
this
transition,
encouraging
confidence
in
those
who
haven’t
cycled
in
a
long
time
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(often
due
to
the
amount
of
traffic
encountered
on
roads),
our
communities
will
gain
through
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
improved health, air quality and nicer environments.
 
 
 
In
2030
we
want
most
people
to
choose
walking
and
cycling
for
short
journeys
and
to
get
into
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
towns.
Adur
and
Worthing
has
shifted
largely
to
electric
vehicles,
with
good
supporting
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
infrastructure
through
a
network
of
accessible
charging
points,
sharing
car
schemes
and
with
joined
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
up public transport choices.
 
 
 
 
 
 
SHARED LEADERSHIP & ECONOMY
 
 
Our
aim
is
for
Adur
and
Worthing
to
support
a
thriving
local
economy,
supporting
entrepreneurs
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
large
businesses
who
work
together
in
making
our
towns
are
sustainable
and
attractive
places
to
live
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and work, maximising the benefits of a green recovery.

Climate Assembly
 
The
councils
are
delivering
a
Climate
Assembly
over
the
autumn
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2020
giving
local
residents
the
opportunity
to
engage
with
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 challenge
of
the
climate
emergency
and
input
their
thoughts
on
what
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we can all do to address climate change.
 
SustainableAW

Created
by
the

to
spotlight
local

on
the

crisis
and
promote
greater

across all sectors and communities.
 
 
What Needs to Happen Next:
 
 
 
●
Ensure
we
look
after
the
health
and
prosperity
of
all
our
communities
as
we
address
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
climate challenge
 
●
Develop
a
coalition
of
businesses
who
share
sustainability
values
and
ambitions,
support
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
them
in
the
delivery
and
sharing
of
advice
and
projects,
exploring
the
potential
for
a
circular
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
economy.
 
●
Lobby
and
apply
for
strategic
funding
through
the
Local
Economic
Partnership
to
support
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
companies
and
organisations
which
enable
sustainable
economic
growth
and
build
this
into
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
economic decision-making.
 
●
Build
a
local
metric
which
looks
beyond
Gross
Domestic
Product
(GDP)
to
incorporate
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
health,
happiness
and
wellbeing
of
local
residents
and
employees,
using
this
to
see
the
wider
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
value of sustainable action and ecological improvements.
 
 
●
Educate
and
empower
businesses
to
look
beyond
perpetual
growth,
exploring
new
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
economic models, such as circular economies and degrowth.
 
●
Build
and
promote
local
entrepreneurs
who
deliver
bespoke
and
unique
businesses
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
services, encouraging local economic activity through local loyalty schemes or currencies.
 
 
●
Use
the
coronavirus
crisis
to
support
a
green
recovery,
helping
businesses
to
align
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
practices
and
services
in
ways
which
grow
economic
activity
without
harming
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
environment.
 
 
 
Often
the
work
we
do
defines
a
large
part
of
our
how
we
see
ourselves,
creating
a
sense
of
purpose
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
self-worth.
When
people
find
themselves
out
of
work,
this
contribution
to
society
is
diminished
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
can
impact
greatly
upon
the
persons’
mental
health.
Moving
Adur
and
Worthing
towards
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ambitions
defined
in
this
action
plan
will
mean
work,
a
lot
of
work.
We
can
create
significant
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
employment locally, upskilling people and leading a green recovery.
 
 
 
Our
existing
businesses
and
enterprises
will
need
to
collaborate
and
partner,
viewing
waste
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resources,
using
their
combined
purchasing
powers
and
innovating
through
new
networks.
Thriving
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
local
economies
are
those
where
the
money
generated,
remains
local,
being
spent
in
our
unique
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shops and services and limiting the amount disappearing into larger, global corporations.
 
 
 
We
also
need
to
recognise
that
perpetual
growth
on
a
finite
planet
is
impossible.
Thriving
local
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
economies
circulate
money
within
themselves,
providing
employees
with
opportunities
outside
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
work,
for
example
through
local
volunteering,
or
supporting
social
aims
beyond
solely
profit
margins.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Increasingly,
companies
are
ensuring
their
workforce
wellbeing
and
seeking
to
enrich
and
support
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the communities where they are established.
 
 
In
2030
we
see
Adur
and
Worthing
having
a
wide
range
of
businesses
and
entrepreneurs
who
work
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collaboratively
to
create
sustainable
economic
activity.
Waste
is
viewed
as
resources
for
others,
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
energy
needed
to
work
comes
from
renewable
sources
and
companies
see
employee
wellbeing
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
integral to their success.
 
 
 
 
  
WASTE
 
 
Our
aim
is
for
Adur
and
Worthing
to
have
maximised
the
amount
of
recycling
collected,
with
most
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
people able to compost food waste and choosing to reduce, repair, reuse and recycle their waste.

levels
of

and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
promoting the circular economy.
 
 
 
What Needs to Happen Next:
 
 
 
●
Implement/promote
green
and
food
waste
collections,
enable
community
composting
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
schemes
and
continue
to
increase
the
amount
of
waste
which
can
be
recycled
by
widely
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
promoting what can and cannot be recycled to homes and businesses.
 
 
●
Support
waste
and
recycling
organisations
to
expand
of
their
work,
limiting
the
amount
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pointless
plastic
used
throughout
services
and
businesses
and
encourage
refillable
or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recyclable packaging.
 
●
Promote food waste reduction to achieve reductions in waste to landfill/incineration
 
●
Support
the
expansion
of
the
Repair
Café
and
its
aims
and
ambitions,
promoting
the
repair
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
consumer
goods,
upskilling
people
across
our
communities
and
promoting
upcycling
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sharing of resources.
 
●
Lobby
for
supermarkets
and
other
local
businesses
to
reduce
their
waste
and
introduce
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
take-back schemes for packaging or old products.
 
 
●
Create
a
sharing
economy
by
enabling
organisations
and
individuals
to
seek
resources
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
equipment from each other, creating shared storage spaces and encouraging swap-shops.
 
●
Work
with
businesses
to
improve
recycling,
reuse
and
composting
in
the
commercial,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
industrial and construction sectors and to reduce waste to landfill/incineration
 
 
Most
people
understand
that
recycling
is
a
good
thing.
We
can
still
do
better,
with
many
items
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thrown
in
general
waste
that
could
be
recycled.
Increasing
the
understanding
and
ease
for
people
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recycle
will
help
reduce
the
costs
and
environmental
harm
associated
with
landfill
or
incineration.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Responsibility
should
also
fall
on
those
who
produce
and
sell
products,
with
the
introduction
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
take-back
schemes,
better
packaging,
and
an
ability
for
the
repair
of
goods
purchased.
Already
some
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 really
successful
projects
are
up
and
running
in
our
area,
which
could
be
expanded
and
supported
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
deliver more.
 
 
 
Food
waste
is
one
area
where
we
lose
a
lot
by
not
using
this
precious
resource.
When
food
is
still
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
edible,
we
need
to
make
sure
that
it
can
be
effectively
distributed
to
those
who
need
it
across
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
communities.
The
newly
formed
Food
Partnership
will
help
support
this
work.
If
food
cannot
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
distributed,
we
should
be
collecting
it
and
composting
it,
returning
the
nutrients
to
our
soil
and
once
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
again,
putting
natural
cycles
into
human
systems.
Where
possible
composting
should
take
place
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
homes
or
businesses,
but
many
successful
community
composting
or
services
are
in
place
across
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
country and these can be replicated locally.
 
 
 
The
questions
and
messages
we
need
to
ask
ourselves
are,
whether
we
need
to
buy
new
or
can
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
borrow
or
repair
the
goods
we
need?
If
we
no
longer
need
something
can
others
in
our
community
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
use
it?
How
can
something
unwanted
be
reused,
upcycled
or
recycled
in
the
best
way?
We
should
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
asking ourselves all of these before we throw things away.
 
 
 
If
we
do
need
to
buy
something
new,
can
we
reduce
the
waste
involved,
by
refilling
or
using
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reusable
containers.
Convenience
in
our
modern
world
has
been
bad
for
our
environment,
with
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
effects now very visible and impacting on our own health.
 
 
 
Adur
and
Worthing
in
2030
should
have
exceptionally
high
rates
of
recycling,
with
no
food
waste.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When
we
shop,
we
do
so
mindful
of
the
cost
beyond
money
and
we
actively
seek
to
share,
repair
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and reuse.
 
 
 
 
 
FOOD
 
 
Our
aim
is
for
everyone
in
Adur
and
Worthing
to
have
access
to
good
quality,
local
food
where
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
communities
understand
how
food
is
grown
and
produced,
and
why
choosing
healthy
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sustainable options is good for them and the planet.
 
 
 
What is already happening locally:
 
 
 
Food Pioneers
 
Organisation
with
several
distinct
projects
creating
food-based
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
experiences
that
enrich
our
communities
and
celebrate
our
natural
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
environment.
Current
projects
include
Worthing
Honey
Collective
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neptune’s Larder.
 
 
TTW 
​
Seed Swap events
 
Annual
event
encouraging
the
sharing
of
seeds
and
plants
to
build
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resilience
in
our
local
food
systems.
The
event
showcases
the
work
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
local nurseries, community projects, creators and makers.
 
 
A
new
Adur
&
 
 
 
 
Worthing
Food
 
 
Partnership
 
The
development
of
a
new
Adur
&
Worthing
Food
Partnership,
being
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
led
by
Community
Matters,will
bring
together
food
banks,
local
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
growers
and
local
community
food
projects
to
help
create
a
fairer,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
more accessible, more sustainable food system.
 
 
Worthing
Food
and
 
 
 
Drink Festival
 
Worthing
Town
Centre
Initiative
run
this
annual
event
to
showcase
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
local suppliers and produce.
 
Community
growing
 
 
and allotments
 
Adur
and
Worthing
has
a
thriving
allotments
sector
with
many
active
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
effective
Allotment
groups.
Several
community
growing
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 allotment
projects
exist
across
Adur
and
Worthing.
All
support
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
communities
to
learn
about
growing
food
and
the
benefits
of
fresh,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tasty produce.
 
 
Sompting Estate
 
Three
farm
estate
which
has
been
exceptional
in
connecting
with
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
community and providing spaces for major community projects.
 
 
 
What Needs to Happen Next:
 
 
 
●
Develop
the
Food
Partnership
into
a
strong
and
successful
network,
where
groups
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
organisations
support
each
other’s
aim
and
ambitions,
promoting
local
producers
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enabling more community growing projects.
 
●
Greater
education
and
promotion
of
sustainable
food:
people
recognise
where
their
food
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
comes
from,
food
miles,
farming
practices,
what
is
healthy
and
sustainable
and
why
it
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
important for their health and our living world to choose a more plant-based, local diet.
 
●
Ensuring
that
no-one
in
our
community
goes
hungry,
that
foodbanks
can
provide
local,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
healthy
options
alongside
donated
provisions
and
that
these
systems
work
efficiently
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collectively with our most vulnerable residents.
 
 
●
Bring
people
together
to
cook
and
share
their
food,
teaching
important
life-skills
to
young
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
people and sharing the knowledge from our older generations.
 
 
●
Support
schools
and
colleges
to
educate
pupils
about
their
food,
teaching
them
important
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
life skills, supporting their independence and welfare.
 
 
 
Food
is
vital
for
life
and
no
one
in
our
community
should
go
hungry.
Whilst
foodbanks
have
filled
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
some
gaps
in
our
social
systems,
they
rely
on
donations
and
still
significant
amounts
of
food
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
wasted
every
day
in
our
area.
The
Food
Partnership
will
bring
together
the
range
of
organisations
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
involved
in
collection
and
distribution,
to
create
robust
systems
and
networks,
reducing
waste
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
making better use of available food for our communities.
 
 
 
We
also
want
to
encourage
and
promote
local
growers
and
producers,
localising
food
distribution
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
limiting
the
amount
of
food
miles
we
need
to
feed
our
communities.
Supporting
small
scale
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
farmers
can
also
favour
better
farming
practices
and
provide
access
to
education
about
where
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
food
comes
and
how
it
is
produced.
By
understanding
farming,
particularly
meat
production,
we
can
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
change
how
people
value
their
food,
knowing
the
care
and
work
involved
in
rearing
animals
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
growing
crops.
The
shift
to
vegetarianism
and
veganism,
or
even
by
eating
better
quality
but
less
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
meat in our diets, will also improve community health and limit farming environmental impacts.
 
 
 
Allotments
and
home
food
growing
has
seen
an
increase
of
interest
in
recent
years
and
a
significant
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
boost
during
the
coronavirus
crisis.
Home
grown
produce
tastes
delicious
and
even
in
the
smallest
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
spaces
we
can
grow
enough
improve
the
quality
of
nutrients
we
consume.
Community
food
growing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and cooking projects improve their participants wellbeing, giving people confidence and new skills.
 
 
In
2030
we
would
like
to
see
our
communities
eating
great
quality
food,
much
of
which
is
sourced
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
locally
and
seasonally,
with
no
one
going
hungry
or
suffering
from
malnutrition.
People
can
easily
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
access
projects,
learning
to
grow
and
produce
food
at
home
or
in
shared
spaces
and
who
also,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
actively choose locally farmed produce.
 
 
 
 
 
 
LAND USE & PLANNING
 
 Our
aim
is
for
Adur
and
Worthing
to
have
high
quality,
sustainable
built
environment,
that
support
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
our
sustainability
ambitions
and
use
our
limited
land
resources
carefully,
maximising
benefits
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
communities, economy and wildlife.
 
 
 
What is already happening locally:
 
 
 
Shoreham
Harbour
 
 
Regeneration
 
The
plan
sets
the
strategic
development
and
land-use
priorities
for
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Shoreham
Harbour
Regeneration
Area
up
to
2032
and
contains
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
policies
against
which
development
management
decisions
within
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
area will be made.
 
 
Adur Local Plan
 
The
new
Local
Plan
sets
the
strategic
development
and
land-use
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
priorities
for
Adur
(outside
of
the
South
Downs
National
Park)
up
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2032
and
contains
the
policies
against
which
development
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
management decisions within that area will be made.
 
Worthing Local Plan
 
The
Council
is
preparing
a
new
development
plan,
the
Worthing
Local
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Plan,
which
will
help
to
deliver
a
more
sustainable
Borough
over
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
next 15 years.
 
Shoreham Society
 
Long
established
group
which
scrutinises
planning
applications
in
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
around
Shoreham.
In
addition,
they
undertake
improvement
projects,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
such as Shoreham-by-Tree.
 
 
Worthing
Heritage
 
 
Alliance
 
Its
key
aims
are
to
represent,
develop
and
promote
the
heritage
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Worthing
and
its
surrounding
area.
To
achieve
these
aims
the
Alliance
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
works in partnership with local regional and national bodies.
 
 
 
What Needs to Happen Next:
 
 
 
●
Lobby
central
Government
to
bring
in
robust
standards
of
planning
policy,
encouraging
zero
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
carbon
development,
and
fair
development
levies
to
support
local
service
provision,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mulit-functional green infrastructure and sustainable transport links.
 
 
●
Provide
communities
with
methods
and
opportunities
to
take
action
and
improve
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
streets
and
community
places,
for
example
through
improving
roadside
verges,
creating
rain
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gardens and flood alleviation schemes, building upon the work of other organisations.
 
 
●
Ensure
that
planning
decisions
consider
future
likelihood
of
drought
and
flooding
conditions,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sea-level
rises
whilst
both
adapting
for
and
mitigating
the
effects
of
climate
change
and
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ecological crisis.
 
 
●
Support
developers
to
deliver
better
sustainable
infrastructure
links
and
multi-functional
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
green
spaces,
good
quality
and
sustainable
transport
infrastructure
which
take
account
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the whole Climate Action Plan.
 
 
●
Protect
and
enhance
our
existing
built
and
natural
heritage,
ensuring
they
are
futureproofed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
climate
resilient
and
that
new
residents,
visitors
and
businesses
can
enjoy
these
services
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the future.
 
 
 
Where
we
live,
nestled
between
the
Downs
and
the
sea,
is
a
beautiful
part
of
the
world.
The
land
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
can
build
upon
is
limited
and
the
wants
from
this
land
are
many.
Our
planning
policies
must
align
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with
national
policy,
so
collectively
we
should
be
asking
for
the
highest
quality
national
planning
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
policies by consistently asking our politicians and Government to uphold quality over quantity.
 
 
 
Our
residents
deserve
to
live
in
affordable
new
homes
that
are
warm
and
close
to
the
services
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
infrastructure
they
need.
New
offices
and
industrial
spaces
should
be
designed
to
be
efficient,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
running
on
renewable
technologies,
prepared
for
extreme
weather
events
and
whose
employees,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where possible, have access to welcoming green spaces during their breaks.
 
  
With
land
at
a
premium
and
our
built
environment
managed
carefully
by
planning
policy,
it
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
important
that
communities
have
a
stake
in
their
local
area.
This
can
be
achieved
when
residents
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
empowered
to
improve
their
local
surroundings
and
engage
in
positive
changes.
This
might
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
through
street
tree
planting
schemes,
adopting
verges
or
drains,
residents’
associations
or
working
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
together
to
generate
community
energy
projects.
Community
efforts
will
build
resilience
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collaborations and can help people achieve great ideas that can be replicated by others.
 
 
 
In
2030
we
want
Adur
and
Worthing
to
have
great
housing,
affordable
for
all,
with
access
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sustainable
transport
and
good
walking
and
cycling
infrastructure.
We
see
multi-functional
green
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
spaces
providing
welcoming,
beautiful
places
that
link
the
Downs
with
the
sea,
benefiting
residents,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
visitors and wildlife.
 
 
 
 
 
 
WELLBEING (ETHOS & SPIRIT)
 
 
Our
aim
is
for
people
living
and
working
in
Adur
and
Worthing
to
feel
happy
and
positive
about
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lives,
their
prospects
and
the
future,
where
neighbours
are
supportive
and
the
most
vulnerable
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
people in our communities are well cared for.
 
 
 
What is already happening locally:
 
 
 
Breathing Spaces
 
Therapeutic
gardening
sessions
with
dementia
patients
and
survivors
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
domestic
abuse.
Now
also
running
a
small
scale
flower
farm
to
revive
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
flower
farming
heritage
of
Worthing
and
respond
to
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
problematic effects of cut flowers.
 
 
Men in Sheds
 
Local
group
that
provides
space,
tools
and
company
for
men
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
undertake their own projects at their own pace.
 
Sustainable Mind
 
Free
mindfulness,
relaxation
and
meditation
courses
to
build
resilience
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and support vulnerable members of the community.
 
Coronavirus Mutual Aid
 
Groups: 
​
Worthing
​
,
 
Shoreham
​
, 
​
Southwick
 
and Fishersgate
 
During
the
Covid
crisis,
multiple
neighbourhood
groups
organically
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
formed
to
ensure
the
most
vulnerable
people
in
their
communities
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were cared for.
 
 
 
What Needs to Happen Next:
 
 
 
●
Provide
opportunities
for
people
to
discuss
their
fears
and
challenges
in
the
adoption
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sustainable
lifestyles,
understanding
the
impact
of
climate
change
and
the
ecological
crisis
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on mental health, particularly for our young people and children.
 
 
●
Create
a
new
narrative
about
our
future,
showing
the
positives
gained
by
people
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
communities
through
shared
action,
promote
this
widely
and
allow
participants
to
talk
about
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their experiences.
 
 
●
Educate
young
people
in
schools
and
colleges
about
our
natural
environment,
providing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
them with the joy of wildlife and showing them the importance of caring for our living world.
 
●
Build
upon
the
mutual
aid
groups
where
possible,
to
harness
the
efforts
of
those
involved
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
caring
for
neighbours
to
form
residents’
associations,
in
turn
providing
skills
training
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
those who want to do more in their areas.
 
 ●
Develop
a
Climate
Advisory
Coalition,
who
can
assess
all
projects
which
grow
from
this
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
action
plan
to
see
where
gaps
are,
how
additional
partnerships
can
create
bigger
gains
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ensuring that no groups are left behind.
 
 
The
effects
of
a
changing
climate
are
scary.
Despite
understanding
the
science
globally
for
forty
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
years,
action
to
date
has
been
limited
and
we
are
now
in
crisis
territory.
This
feels
overwhelming
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
many,
particularly
our
young
people
who
see
little
hope
and
are
worried
about
their
futures.
We
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
need to take action to prevent a climate and ecological catastrophe and give everyone hope.
 
 
In
doing
so,
we
will
create
happier,
healthier
residents;
people
who
are
more
connected
with
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
neighbours
and
who
feel
able
to
improve
their
areas.
We
can
create
secure,
skilled
jobs
during
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transition
and
build
a
thriving
local
economy
with
unique
shops
and
services
for
residents
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
visitors
alike.
We
can
revive
our
local
wildlife,
making
beautiful
spaces
where
people
can
enjoy
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
nature
and
feel
wonder,
joy
and
calm.
Our
homes
and
properties
can
be
protected
from
extreme
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
weather and we can all enjoy the benefits of reduced bills and the security of utilities and food.
 
 
 
In
delivering
this
action
plan,
we
will
hear
voices
from
those
concerned
about
the
costs,
the
reality
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
giving
up
our
existing
conveniences,
who
resist
change
and
dispute
science.
This
is
ok.
These
voices
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
can
be
carried
and
acknowledged,
participating
in
the
changes
they
want,
when
they
want,
without
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
holding
back
on
vital
action.
Those
who
can
see
this
future
can
lead
the
change.
There
are
many,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
many
individuals,
organisations
and
businesses
already
working
towards
this.
We
now
need
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
everyone
who
shares
a
vision
of
a
cleaner,
safer
and
more
beautiful
world
to
step
up
and
make
this
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vision
a
reality.
By
building
stronger
partnerships
and
networks,
we
can
know
our
collective
actions
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are amounting to much more than we can achieve independently.
 
 
 
Our
vision
for
2030
sees
Adur
and
Worthing
benefiting
from
close-knit
communities,
who
feel
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
work
is
worthwhile
and
important
and
who
enjoy
the
many
experiences
that
our
area
can
offer.
We
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
want our residents to be environmentally aware, considerate of their consumption and waste.
