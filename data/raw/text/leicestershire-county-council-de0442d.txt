Foreword   3 Cllr Blake P ain, Cabinet Lead for Environment
Leicestershire County Council has a long-established  
commitment to the environment and has done much to reduce  
its impact on the environment. However , there is much more  
we need to do, especially as we work with others to meet the  
challenges of climate change and eco -system decline.Environment Strategy - At a glance  5

  35In my privileged role as Lead Member for Environment I am becoming  
increasingly aware of and worried by the over whelming scientific  
information that highlights the existing and future impacts of climate  
change and the significant decline in our natural environment. As a county  
councillor and Cabinet member , I believe we must tak e a leadership role  
in building on the global and national commitments made to address the  
situation by lobbying government and working with par tners to tak e action  
within Leicestershire.
In recent years there have been growing public calls for action on the  
environment and climate change, be that in terms of reducing the use  
of single use plastics, improving air quality , encouraging the use of low  
emissions vehicles and improving energy efficiency . 
In response Leicestershire County Council has declared a climate  
emergency and made a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030  
from our own operations and to work with others and to lobby government  
to achieve carbon neutrality for Leicestershire by 2050 or before.
This revised Environment Strategy tak es account of these commitments as  
well as the latest information and key drivers for action on the environment.  
It recognises that if we are to mak e a positive difference to the lives of  
Leicestershire people we need to protect and enhance the environment and  
meet the challenges and oppor tunities of climate change.  
Deliver y of this Strategy will require significant collaborative working within  
Leicestershire County Council, with the communities of Leicestershire and  
with par tner organisations.
I look for ward to suppor ting this collaborative effor t to ensure a better  
future for the people of Leicestershire and for future generations.
There are clear drivers for action to protect and improve the environment and to tackle  
climate change at a global, national and local level. Leicestershire County Council  
is building on its longstanding commitment to the environment and taking action to  
reduce the impact of its operations on the environment, its contribution to climate  
change and to ensure its assets are resilient to the effects of climate change.
The Council will also work with par tners to protect and enhance the Leicestershire  
environment and help to deliver sustainable development by recognising and fostering  
the links between the environment, people and the economy .
Figure 1 seeks to provide  
an ‘at a glance’ summar y of 
the Environment Strategy . It 
identifies the k ey internal and  
external drivers for action and  
also acknowledges that our use  
of resources and energy and the  
deliver y of council ser vices have  
an impact on the environment.  
It also highlights the more  
significant environmental  
impact that arises from  
domestic, industrial and  
transpor t sources within  
Leicestershire as people and  
businesses go about their  
daily lives.These drivers and factors have  
informed the development of  
the Environment Strategy , its 
vision , its aims across 6 themes  
and the combination of internal  
and external objectives.
These are suppor ted by a set of  
targets, a robust per formance  
monitoring system and an  
appropriate governance  
structure which oversees and  
manages deliver y through an  
evolving Action Plan which is  
regularly reviewed.

7 6Introduction
There is increasing recognition of , and commitment to, the need to protect, promote 
and improve the environment at a local, national and global level. 
The Council is committed to minimising its environmental impacts, protecting  
and enhancing the Leicestershire environment and helping to deliver sustainable  
development by recognising and fostering the links between the environment, people  
and our economy .
This Strategy sets out our  
vision , aims, objectives and  
targets which will be used to  
drive improved environmental  
performance.
The scope of the Strategy  
covers both the Council’s own  
operations and also where it  
has control and influence within  
the county of Leicestershire. It  
includes the legal and statutor y 
duties we must fulfil regarding  
the environment, what we need  
to do to embed environmental  
sustainability into the effective  
and efficient running of the  
Council and what we need to  
do to fulfil our leadership role in  
creating a better environment,  
improving the health and  
wellbeing of people and  
contributing to the sustainable  
economic development of the  
county .Leicestershire County Council (LCC) has a longstanding  
commitment to the environment. This includes:
•
 2006: LCC signed up to the  
Nottingham Declaration on  
Climate Change;
•
 2008: LCC was accepted  
into the Carbon T rust’s 
Local Authorities Carbon  
Management P rogramme;  
•

Action PlanInternal & External ObjectivesInternal External8 9Envir onment Str ategy key drivers
The key drivers for action on the environment come from global, national and local 
levels. While this has long been the case, events in recent years have strengthened 
and brought into clearer focus the need for action.
The urgent need for concer ted 
international action on climate  
change has been recognised by  
over 170 countries globally .
The Paris Agreement of 2015  
requires countries to work  
together in limiting global  
temperature rise to below  
1.5 to 2°C, the recognised  
level established by the  
Intergovernmental P anel on  
Climate Change to limit the  
risks and impacts of climate  
change.
The interconnection between  
economic development, social  
equity and inclusion and  
environmental impacts has also  
been recognised internationally  
via the 2030 Agenda for  
Sustainable Development.
It sets out 17 Sustainable  
Development Goals (SDGs) that  
Governments are expected to  
translate into national action  
plans, policies and initiatives.
The UK Government has  
committed to action under both  
the Paris Agreement and the  
2030 Agenda for Sustainable  
Development. Its prioritisation  
of action on climate change  
can be seen in the Climate  
Change Act 2008 (2050 T arget 
Amendment) Order 2019 . This set a legally binding  
greenhouse gas emission  
reduction target of 100% by  
2050, i.e. net zero greenhouse  
gas emissions by 2050. If  
this target is to be achieved  
transformational action is  
required.
In suppor t of this, there are  
a range of policy initiatives  
designed to change the way we  
use and manage energy , water , 
resources, land and transpor t. 
This means contributions  
from ever yone, including local  
government.
The UK Government’s Clean  
Growth Strategy  underlines the  
role that local government has  
in delivering and suppor ting 
our evolution to a low carbon  
society as we respond to these  
national and international  
commitments.
In recognition of this,  
Leicestershire County Council  
declared a climate emergency  
and commitment to achieve  
carbon neutrality by 2030 for  
its own operations.
The Council has also committed  
to work with others and to  
lobby government to suppor t 
the target to achieve net zero  
carbon by 2050.The UK Government’s 25-year  
Environment Plan  recognises  
that ‘natural capital’ – the air  
we breathe, water we drink, soil  
we cultivate and the ecosystem  
we rely on – is essential to  
economic growth and long-term  
productivity . It links to many of  
the themes in the Clean Growth  
Strategy . It acknowledges that  
deliver y of the plan will require  
contributions from ever yone, 
including local government.  
Its six goals are relevant to the  
impacts that we need to assess  
as a council in providing our  
services and fulfilling our broad  
range of environmental duties  
and responsibilities:
Goals of the 25 Y ear 
Environment Plan
• Clean air ;
•
 Reducing the risks of harm  
from environmental hazards;
•
 Clean and plentiful water ;
•
 Using resources from nature  
more sustainably and  
efficiently ;
•
 Thriving plants and wildlife;
and
•
 Enhanced beauty , heritage  
and engagement with the  
natural environment.With the making of these  
commitments, the development  
of these documents and  
systems, combined with the  
hard work of Council staff  
and par tners, we have made  
measurable progress in reducing  
the Council’s environmental  
impact. Of par ticular note  
has been:
• 63% reduction in the  
Council’s own greenhouse  
gas emissions (GHG) since  
2008-09;  
• Significant increase in low/
zero carbon energy generation  
on Council buildings and  
land. It is currently 16% of  
all Council building energy  
consumption (from zero in  
2013-14); and
• Reduction in business  
mileage of 3.5 million miles  
since 2012. This is a saving  
of more than 1,150 tonnes  
of CO2e.
•
 Within the County the  
following progress has tak en 
place.  
•
 Domestic GHG emissions  
have reduced by 32%  
(against 2005 baseline),  
with electricity emissions  
reduced by 55%; and
•
 Non-domestic (Industrial  
and commercial) electricity  
related GHG emissions  
have been reduced by  
57%, gas emissions  
reduced by 23% and other  
fuels also reduced by 39%.These achievements have been  
made at a time of considerable  
financial challenge for the  
Council, though many of them  
have contributed to significant  
financial savings including:
•
 £1.1m saved on electricity  
bills through the project to  
introduce LED streetlighting;  
•
 £505,000 saved through  
reduced business mileage;  
and
•
 £78,000 saved through  
reduced residual waste  
and increased recycling  
performance from Council  
buildings.
The Strategy has been  
updated to tak e account of  
the commitments made in the  
climate emergency declaration  
and with the latest available  
information and figures. It will  
provide strong guidance for  
the Council’s future actions  
and enable it to continue its  
leadership role in this area  
and help deliver an improved  
environment for both the people  
of Leicestershire and those  
living fur ther afield who are  
affected by our actions.10 11The Government’s 25-year  
Environment Plan promotes the  
use and management of land  
in a sustainable manner , the 
enhancement and recover y of 
landscapes and the connection  
of people with the environment  
to promote health and  
wellbeing. It also promotes an  
increase in resource efficiency  
and a reduction in pollution  
and waste, securing a clean , 
productive and biologically  
diverse sea and ocean and  
protection and improvement  
of the global environment. It  
identifies that one of the k ey 
ways this will be implemented  
and achieved is through better  
local planning and more  
effective par tnerships.
The Government has also  
launched a national Clean Air  
Strategy . A UK plan for tackling  
roadside nitrogen dioxide (NO2)  
concentrations was published in  
July 2017. The document notes  
the impact of poor air quality , 
not only on life expectancy but  
also in terms of wider health,  
productivity and wellbeing. It  
also notes the wider impact of  
pollution on the environment.
In the specific case of NO2 
it is noted that impacts relate  
to relative concentrations and  
therefore are ver y localised.  
It is therefore up to local  
authorities in par tnership to  
develop local plans to manage  
and reduce NO2 levels where it  
is determined to be an issue.“Clean growth is not an option, but a  
duty we owe to the ne xt generation, and  
economic growth has to go hand-in-hand  
with greater protection for our forests  
and beaches, clean air and places of  
outstanding natural beauty .”
[Clean Growth Strategy , Theresa May , 2017]
“We’re proud to be a green council and  
we’re committed to tackling climate  
change and laying down the roots to  
protect local wildlife habitats. It’s clear  
there is a climate emergency and we’re  
committed to thinking globally and acting  
locally . That’s why we’re redoubling our  
efforts. The investment and long list  
of projects we’re e xploring signals our  
determination to tackle this head on.”
[Cllr Nick R ushton, Leader of Leicestershire County Council, 2020]The Government’s draf t 
Environment Bill 2019 sets  
out how the Government  
will maintain environmental  
standards as the UK leaves the  
European Union and builds on  
the vision set out in the 25 year  
Environment Plan .
The Bill includes the creation  
of an independent body , 
the Office of Environmental  
Protection , which will scrutinise  
environmental law and the  
government’s Environmental  
Improvement Plan , and 
investigate complaints and  
take enforcement action on  
environmental law .
The Bill sets out air quality , 
water, nature and biodiversity  
and waste and resource  
efficiency as the four priority  
areas which will each have  
legally binding targets.The 2019 State of Nature  
report pools data and  
expertise from over 50 nature  
conser vation and research  
organisations and gives a  
cutting edge over view of the  
state of nature in the UK.  
Its conclusions include that  
since 1970:
•
 15% of species are under  
threat of extinction and 2%  
of species have already gone  
for good;  
“Escalating pressures, such as climate  
change and modern land management,  
mean that we continue to lose the precious  
wildlife that enriches our lives and is  
essential to the health and well-being of  
those who live in the UK.”
[State of Nature R eport 2016, David Attenborough]•
 41% of UK species studied  
have fallen in numbers;
•
 Numbers of butter flies and  
moths are down 17% and  
25% respectively ;
•
 The average amount of  
mammals has fallen by  
26%;
•
 97% of the UK’s wildflower  
meadows have been lost in  
the last 100 years; and
•
 Only 13% of the UK land is  
covered by woodland, 66%  
of which is not managed  
sustainably .The global scientific community  
is increasingly repor ting on  
biodiversity loss of such a scale  
that it is considered that we are  
on the edge of the sixth mass  
extinction in Ear th’s histor y. 
The Zoological Society of  
London analysed 3,000  
species and found that 50%  
of individual animals have  
been lost since 1970.
The International Union for  
Conser vation of Nature repor t 
that one in four mammals  
and one in eight birds face a  
high risk of extinction in the  
near future and that the rapid  
loss of species we are seeing  
today is estimated by exper ts 
to be between 1,000 and  
10,000 times higher than  
the “background” or expected  
natural extinction rate.
Cllr Nick Rushton after signing up to the UK 100 Clean Energy PledgeThere are a number of pieces of  
legislation that place par ticular  
duties on local authorities  
regarding the conser vation , 
management and access  
to the natural environment,  
for example the Wildlife  
& Countr yside Act 1981,  
Countr yside & Rights of W ay 
Act 2000 (CR oW) and the  
Natural Environment & R ural 
Communities Act (NERC)  
2006 . 
At a local level, the Leicester , 
Leicestershire & R utland  
Biodiversity Action Plan  
sets out the commitment to  
biodiversity and habitats from  
2016 to 2026 and provides  
a framework for action for the  
county as a whole.  
In the context of these  
drivers, the increasing societal  
movement to protect and  
improve the environment  
and to tak e action on climate  
change as well as the Council’s  
leadership role, it is critical  
that we understand the  
environmental impacts of our  
activities and the benefits  
of having an Environment  
Strategy .
This Strategy allows us  
to demonstrate to all our  
stakeholders that we are  
an environmentally aware,  
responsible and committed  
Council. It allows us to  
communicate our strategic  
environmental direction and  
our environmental aims and  
objectives to all stak eholders.Having an Environment  
Strategy benefits us as  
a Council by : 
•
 Enabling us to comply with  
all relevant legislation and  
environmental laws;
12 13•
 Suppor ting our staff in  
making more sustainable  
choices, k eeping them  
informed about their  
environmental roles and  
responsibilities;
•
 Enabling us to identif y 
oppor tunities to invest in  
initiatives that reduce our  
environmental impact and,  
in the longer term, save us  
money ;
•
 Reducing the risk of  
environmental incidents  
that result in negative local  
impacts;
•
 Suppor ting national and  
international effor ts in 
combatting the impacts of  
and adapting to climate  
change, reducing resource  
consumption and the  
generation of waste and  
addressing the loss of  
biodiversity ;
•
 Improving our reputation;
•
 Suppor ting national and  
international effor ts in 
combatting the impacts of  
and adapting to climate  
change;
•
 Improving the tracking of our  
environmental per formance  
so we can identif y both  
progress and problems and  
seek to continually improve;•
 Improving the way in which  
we deliver ser vices to  
reduce our impact on the  
environment;
•
 Reducing the public  
health impacts of climate  
change and a deteriorating  
environment; and
•
 Suppor ting effor ts to develop  
a more sustainable economy  
for Leicestershire.
The Council’s overall strategic  
vision is to ‘ work together  
for the benefit of ever yone’ 
and to mak e a positive  
difference in the lives of the  
people of Leicestershire.  
The development of this  
Environment Strategy and its  
subsequent implementation will  
contribute significantly to the  
achievement of this vision .The envir onmental issues and  
their cont ext
As a County Council we are responsible for:
•
 Complying with legislation relating to the  
environmental impacts arising from our day to day  
activities, such as heating and powering our offices,  
using vehicles and generating waste;
•
 Carrying out statutor y and non-statutor y duties to  
enable effective management of cer tain environmental  
impacts arising from the activities of Leicestershire  
residents and businesses, such as air pollution from  
local transpor t and the reduction, recycling and  
disposal of household waste; and
•
 Enforcing environmental legislation on businesses,  
such as in relation to product packaging, banned  
substances and energy cer tificates.
In addition to these  
responsibilities our actions  
are influenced by our wish to  
improve the efficiency of the  
Council, meet the financial  
challenges we are facing, be  
responsive to governmental  
policies and show leadership  
and provide a good example to  
the community .In Figure 2 we illustrate how  
our use of resources and energy

We have carried out an assessment of the rationale for us to tak e action on environmental issues,  
taking into account our duties and responsibilities and the threats that environmental issues pose to  
the effective deliver y of our ser vices. This rationale is set out in Appendix 1.Envir onment P olicy
The Council recognises the inter -dependency between environmental, social and  
economic well-being and the essential role it plays in balancing this inter -dependency  
through ser vice deliver y and in our wider leadership role.  
This Environment Strategy sets out our policy position and the scope of our roles and  
responsibilities and states our vision, aims, objectives and targets. These will drive  
action to ensure we are meeting our environmental obligations and commitments,  
embedding environmental sustainability into the effective running of council  
services and fulfilling our leadership role in a way that recognises and minimises our  
environmental impact, improves the wellbeing of people and suppor ts a resilient clean  
growth economy .
Scope
The Environment Strategy  
recognises that the Council  
has different levels of control  
and influence in managing and  
protecting the environment,  
minimising its global  
environmental impacts and  
meeting the challenges and  
oppor tunities of climate change.  
The scope of the Strategy  
covers both the Council’s own  
operations and also where it  
has control and influence within  
the county of Leicestershire.The scope includes:
• The legal and statutor y duties  
that we must fulfil regarding  
the environment and the  
national response to climate  
change;
• What we need to do to  
embed environmental  
sustainability into the  
effective and efficient running  
of council ser vices;
and
• What we need to do to  
fulfil our leadership role in  
a way that recognises and  
minimises environmental  
impacts, improves the health  
and wellbeing of people and  
contributes to the sustainable  
economic development of the  
county .The Strategy also recognises  
the environmental issues that  
affect the Council and its ability  
to provide ser vices and meet its  
obligations. The most significant  
issue is that of climate change  
and the related impacts such  
as an increase in the frequency  
and intensity of storms, flooding  
and heatwaves, prolonged cold  
periods and changes in pests  
and diseases.16 17These impacts are expected  
to include; damage to  
infrastructure and proper ty, 
making the movement of people  
and goods more difficult, an  
increase in human death,  
disability and injur y, and greater  
food shor tages and rising food  
prices.
This Strategy coordinates the  
Council’s overall approach to  
environmental management,  
recognising that there are a  
number of separate strategies  
and plans that deliver  
aspects of our environmental  
duties, responsibilities and  
commitments.
This Strategy is not a static  
document and it will be  
updated ever y five years.  
This five year timeframe is  
consistent with ‘stocktak es’ as  
agreed in the P aris Agreement  
and the timeframes used  
for the UK Government’s  
carbon budgets. It will allow  
the Strategy to respond to  
changes in environmental  
policies and the wider context  
and circumstances in which it  
operates, coupled with a more  
agile Action Plan .“Leicestershire County Council will  
minimise the environmental impact  
of its activities and will improve  
the wider environment through  
local action. W e will play our full  
part to protect the environment  
of Leicestershire. W e will tackle  
climate change and embed  
environmental sustainability into  
what we do.”

Here we set out the high-level environmental targets of the Council for the period up  
to 2030 where possible. Where this has not been done we will work with colleagues  
and par tners to develop targets up to 2030 and to develop additional targets for  
the range of environmental aspects such as resource use, biodiversity , pollution,  
health and wellbeing and the local economy . It is impor tant that any targets are  
ambitious yet realistic and this will take fur ther discussion, analysis and agreement to  
accomplish.
Achievement of these targets  
is suppor ted by a prioritised  
Action Plan . In addition , to 
suppor t the work to achieve  
carbon neutrality for the  
Council’s own operations and  
for Leicestershire, a Carbon  
Reduction R oadmap will be  
produced setting out the k ey 
workstreams for achieving  
these targets.  
We will also establish a suite  
of suppor ting targets where  
appropriate. These will be set  
out within the Action Plan .Where possible, when setting  
the targets, a baseline of our  
performance as at 2016-17 has  
been established.
As a minimum we aim to  
reduce the county ’s GHG  
emissions in line with the  
UK Government’s carbon  
budgets, as vital steps towards  
suppor ting the government’s  
long-term target of net zero  
GHG emissions by 2050.

development of a low carbon  
circular economyN1.  Minimise the impact on the  
environment of the Council’s  
procurement and deliver y of 
goods and ser vices, including  
through the reduced use  
of raw materials and fossil  
fuels, the increased use of  
renewable energy and the  
deployment of smar ter and

* compared to 2016-17 baseline levelsIt will not be possible to reduce  
the Council’s greenhouse gas  
emissions to zero by 2030  
and a cer tain level of carbon  
offsetting will be required. This  
will be done af ter all reasonable  
efforts have been tak en to 
reduce emissions.
In order to achieve these overall  
GHG emissions targets, initial  
suppor ting targets have been set  
for specific council operations  
where these emissions arise.We have also set initial  
additional targets that will  
contribute to reducing the  
level of GHG emissions from  
within Leicestershire where  
we have a level of control and  
influence to do so . Work has  
also commenced on working  
with par tners to develop plans  
for reducing emissions from  
within the County which will  
also contribute towards setting  
any targets.As these and other targets are  
further developed and refined  
the suite of targets will be  
updated accordingly .
We will periodically review  
these targets to consider  
relevant updates provided by  
the UK Government, and ensurethat the targets represent a  
continuous improvement in  
our per formance.
1 This target is under review since the government issued the Nationa l Resources and 
Waste Strategy . New target expected in 2021Performance Monit oring and Governance
Performance monitoring of the Strategy will be managed through the Council’s  
Environmental Management System, (which has been developed in line with  
ISO 14001 requirements), together with a number of suppor ting per formance  
management systems. This will include per formance monitoring of the high-level  
targets set out in the Strategy and the additional suppor ting targets and KPIs which  
form par t of the Action Plan.
Where targets, KPIs or  
monitoring systems have yet  
to be established these will be  
developed through the Action  
Plan process in consultation  
with relevant officers and  
partners.In par ticular we will develop  
additional targets and KPIs  
to suppor t environmental  
aspects such as resource use,  
biodiversity , pollution , health  
and wellbeing and the local  
economy . This will allow the  
targets to be measurable and  
monitored throughout the life  
of the strategy to demonstrate  
progress and achievement.Progress towards the targets  
using the KPI data will be  
regularly repor ted to a range  
of internal stak eholders. In  
addition , an environmental  
performance summar y repor t 
will be published on the  
Council’s website each year .
In terms of governance the ongoing deliver y of the Environment Strategy will be  
overseen by chief officers sitting as the Corporate Management T eam (CMT).
The Environment Strategy  
will be implemented by the  
Environment Strategy  
Deliver y Board.  
Board members are drawn from  
service areas k ey to the deliver y 
of the Environment Strategy . 
The board will engage with  
external par tners to suppor t 
the deliver y of the Strategy and  
Action Plan and will promote  
partnership working where  
appropriate. Membership  
therefore, remains flexible to the  
priorities outlined in the Action  
Plan which will be reviewed on  
an annual basis.The Environment Strategy  
Deliver y Board will establish  
project-specific task & finish  
groups to drive progress  
which will be repor ted to the  
Environment & T ranspor t Lead  
Member and to CMT , while  
Scrutiny Commission and the

periodically .With CMT’s suppor t, specific  
activities and programmes  
of work suppor ting the  
aims and objectives of the  
Environment Strategy will be  
the responsibility of relevant  
service area leads. This will  
reflect specific actions within  
the different ser vice areas and  
wider initiatives with strategic  
partners and others.26 27How the Envir onment Str ategy 
contri butes to the Counci l’s Strategic Plan
Leicestershire County Council’s Strategic Plan  
2018-22 entitled ‘ Working together for the benefit of  
everyone’ takes an outcome-based approach which  
focusses on the difference the Council wants to make.  
In doing so it has developed five strategic outcomes  
essential for achieving the vision of a good quality  
of life in Leicestershire.
Working together for 
the benefit of everyone
Leicestershire  County Council’s  
Strategic  PlanFollowing the climate emergency  
declaration , the Strategic Plan  
2018-22 has been revised so  
as to embed the commitmentsmade as par t of the declaration . 
This puts the Council’s  
commitments to reduce carbon  
and to protect the environmentat the hear t of its strategic

committed to a set of guiding  
principles which will shape  
its approach and define how  
it works as an organisation to  
achieve this vision .These principles include a  
strengthened commitment  
that the Council will fulfil  
its leadership role for the  
environment by taking action  
to be carbon neutral by 2030  
and to reverse the decline in  
biodiversity .This Strategy provides a  
framework for how this  
commitment will be achieved.Appendix 1 Summary of Council’s

Term Definition
Carbon Dioxide  A standard unit for measuring carbon footprints. It expresses the impact of  
Equivalent (CO2e)each different greenhouse gas in terms of the amount of CO2 that would create  
the same amount of warming.
Carbon Neutral The action of removing as much carbon dioxide as possible from the  
atmosphere due to an organisation ’s operations, with any residual emissions  
addressed through carbon offsetting to achieve a net zero carbon footprint.
Carbon Offsetting The action or process of compensating for carbon dioxide emissions arising  
from industrial or other human activity , by par ticipating in schemes designed to  
make equivalent reductions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Circular Economy A more resource efficient alternative to a traditional linear economy (mak e, 
use, dispose) where resources are used for as long as possible, the maximum  
value is extracted whilst in use, then products and materials are recovered,  
regenerated or recycled at the end of their ser vice life.
Clean Growth  The UK’s strategy for clean growth including oppor tunities for the UK and next  
Strategy steps to meet the future carbon budgets.
Climate Change  The Act ensures that the net UK carbon account for all six K yoto greenhouse  
Act 2008 gases for the year 2050 is at least 80% lower than the 1990 baseline. The  
Act aims to enable the United Kingdom to become a low-carbon economy and
