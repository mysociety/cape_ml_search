Foreword
I am pleased to present Kingston’s updated Climate Action Plan.
In June 2019, Kingston Council declared a
Climate
Emergency
, with a commitment to deliver carbon neutrality
in council operations
by 2038. At that time, we committed to eliminating as many of the Council’s emissions as possible, and offsetting emissions where
we could not reduce any further. Since then, teams across the council have come together to develop our plans and to begin to
deliver carbon reduction for Kingston, and in September 2021, I shared a draft plan with the Place Committee, with a commitment to
ask our communities for their views on the actions we had set out. In response to this request, community groups came together to
feed back their thoughts, and over 200 responses were submitted online.
Our residents and stakeholders made it clear that, while you are interested in our work to improve council buildings and reduce carbon in operations, you
were most interested in how you could make a difference, how you could work together to deliver this ambition for Kingston, and how actions would impact
upon the residents and stakeholders of Kingston.
As a result of this feedback, we have made the decision to revise Kingston’s carbon reduction targets. We will now aim to be carbon neutral in operations
by the challenging target of 2030, and to widen our actions to help move our borough to carbon neutrality by 2038.
Addressing climate change is everyone’s responsibility and it requires widespread support to make an impact. We have had success to date in terms of
working closely with our local strategic partners, businesses, and community groups, as well as neighbouring boroughs, the Mayor of London and Central
Government. We will enhance this focus and increasingly take a role as an influencer and facilitator for change in our borough. Wherever our powers or
financial constraints make it difficult to go far enough, fast enough, we will lobby national government for further powers and finance.
We have made lots of progress and we have support from our community to move forward but there is much more to do. This action plan will continue to
grow and develop, with delivery being led both by priority and funding availability. I will continue the Kingston Climate Conversation with residents and
stakeholders as we move forward together to take collective action to protect our borough from the impacts of climate change.

44Introduction
There is a global consensus that climate change is happening.
Evidence makes it clear that there is a need for us all to take action to address both the causes of climate change and the impacts of these changes. In
declaring a Climate Emergency in 2019, Kingston Council committed to take decisive action to reduce carbon in all activity that we control.
In September 2021 we shared our draft Action Plan with residents to give them the opportunity to understand our initial plans and provide feedback.
Through this feedback we saw that, although the Council’s focus on carbon within our direct control was important, many residents wanted much more
focus on the borough’s carbon footprint and on action which could support them to make a difference.
We wish to harness this energy and enthusiasm, and in recognition of this we have reflected on the level of ambition for Kingston. We now wish to restate
our
shared ambition
for carbon neutrality as follows:
Addressing climate change is everyone's responsibility and we collectively have a role to play on the journey to 2030 and 2038. We know that we are not
able to do this on our own but we do recognise the leadership role that we can take. While local authorities have limited direct control over total carbon
emissions, they have powers or influence over roughly a third of emissions in their local area
.
As such,
communities are looking to local authorities to help
1
generate pace and momentum, which will be absolutely vital to achieving this challenging shared ambition for Kingston .
This is a step change in terms of focus and will require us to identify new ways of working to enable the delivery of our ambition. A key aspect of this is
around the role of the Council, expanding the focus from what we can control to what we can influence. We need to give consideration to the role of the
wider community and businesses beyond the council’s own operations.

This visual aims to show how complex the system is and how
only small parts of it are controllable by the Council. Much more
is around how to work with other people and organisation to
influence and effect changes in behaviour whilst recognising that
some change is outside of our scope
of influence and requires global and national policy change
to have further impact:
We know that the revised ambition is challenging and that our ability to achieve this will be dependent upon many factors. However, we do not want that to
constrain our level of ambition at this stage. We are committed to working together and trying to overcome the challenges ahead by seizing the
opportunities together with our community to secure a Cleaner, Greener Kingston.
As we move forward our approach to governance and monitoring our impact will be key to help everyone to understand the progress that Kingston is
making and to enable us to refine our plans to match our ambition. As we embark on this journey we will continue to adapt and respond to learning, thereby
giving us the greatest chance of achieving our ambition of carbon neutrality.

Background
In 2018, the Royal Borough of Kingston developed its
Environmental Management Plan
. This set out how green
infrastructure and sustainable
management is integrated in the built environment, and how communities will be enabled to deliver positive change in their local area. While that plan
remains a key response for us, it does not go far enough to tackle the climate challenge. On 25 June 2019, Kingston declared a
Climate Emergency
and
began putting in place actions to deliver against it. In November of that year, we published our
Climate
Emergency Initial Assessment
which set out our
current carbon management position and the actions we would begin to take to reduce carbon. Since this time we have been developing our understanding
of the challenge, to clearly set out the steps we have to take to reduce carbon in Kingston.

44The Council’s Role
This presents an exciting opportunity for us to consider our role as a facilitator and an enabler for change. We have a key role to play as an influencer within
Kingston, however, we cannot do this alone. More than ever, we need to work with the wider community and local businesses to encourage them to take a
role in delivering impact.
We already know that there is lots of good activity happening outside of the council, with many active community groups. Part of our role will be helping to
join up the positive activity already underway, signposting and helping our residents to understand what is already happening, along with helping them see
a role for themselves. The engagement activity to date has provided a very clear steer in terms of the need to be creative in our approach to engagement.
Key principles of our refreshed approach:
●
We can’t deliver everything ourselves, but we can help and empower our community;
●
We will work together with our partners and the community, engaging stakeholders in project delivery;
●
We will identify "hard to reach” groups of people across the borough to ensure diversity of thought. We will need to reach those who may not
traditionally be interested in climate change;
●
We will accept that solutions will not always be acceptable to everyone and will require some bold decisions to be made;
●
We can’t do it all in one go. We will target those areas that will have the biggest impact first, and build confidence in delivery;
●
We will reduce carbon emissions as far as we can and offset what we cannot remove;
●
We will achieve carbon neutrality for council operations by 2030;
●
We will prioritise green and decentralised energy;
●
We will ensure the climate implications of our actions are a key factor in decision-making;
●
We will be proactive about bringing funding into the borough;
●
We will, in tandem, prepare to protect Kingston from the impacts of unavoidable changes in our weather;
●
Leadership will be key – not only in setting the ambition but also in aiding it’s delivery.

44The co-benefits of climate action
Taking Climate Action will bring real positives for Kingston that are much wider than protecting our community from adverse weather impacts. A cleaner,
greener Kingston is a healthier borough, with reduced NHS costs, better housing, better transport and a reduction in poverty and inequality. Some of the
‘co-benefits’ of taking action include:
Co-benefits
Co-benefits
Quiet, safe streets
Healthier, more active people
Warmer, quieter homes
A reduction in poverty and inequality
Green jobs
More local consumption with thriving local
businesses and high streets
Green spaces that are alive with biodiversity
Better air quality
Locally generated, secure energy
Community engagement
Adaptation
While the priority of this plan is a reduction in local carbon emissions in order to limit the impact of warming global temperatures, we must also aim to help
places, people, and nature be ready for unavoidable climate change (we call this
climate change adaptation
).
This includes understanding risks and
opportunities from climate change for business, infrastructure, housing, and the natural environment. There is a need to prepare services to deliver for the
needs of the community as weather patterns change.
Therefore, adaptation measures cover many of the climate change themes, while promoting the need to provide secure and affordable energy, food, water,
and transport, which enables the community to operate its businesses and services without impact on health and the economy. Adaptation actions are
embedded throughout the relevant themes.

Engagement approach
In October we made our draft Climate Action Plan available via the Kingston Climate Conversation Hub on the Council’s Let’s Talk engagement portal. A
summary of the key insights is shown below but the full engagement feedback summary and insights can be found in Annex 2 of this report:
●
The invitation to join the Kingston climate conversation received 300+ contributions;
●
Engagement was highest for themes most connected to day-to-day life, with travel receiving the most contributions, followed by efficient homes and
waste reduction. Considering what people are most energised by and what they connect to most will help inform future engagement plans and
approaches;
●
For those engaged in the conversation, many thought Climate Action should be a priority for the Council;
●
People engaged in the conversation shared a range of ideas to contribute to the plan and action on climate;
●
There are some differing views on the role the Council should play, as well as recognition where others have a key role (from individual behaviours
and lifestyles to government policy);
●
Engaging communities in a new way will require a different role of the Council as a facilitator, bringing together and working with system partners, for
example health, neighbouring authorities, businesses etc.
●
This will also mean finding new ways to bring the climate conversation to life at a local level, explaining what climate change will mean for local
communities and for individuals to help overcome barriers in participation of individuals, communities and businesses - from engaging in discussion
to playing an active role in taking climate action.

44Engagement - helping communities
People were asked how the Council could help communities understand the impact of climate change. Many of the responses focused on a different role
for the Council, moving further into areas where we can influence change.

Key next steps for engagement
We would like to thank everyone for their input to date. Moving forward there will be many more opportunities to be involved, not only in providing feedback
and shaping plans but also in taking a role in their delivery. We know that we can’t do this on our own and it will require significant community engagement,
energy, and commitment for us to reach our ambition of a carbon neutral Kingston by 2038.
There are a number of key next steps including developing a detailed communication and engagement plan for the next 12-24 months and beyond. The
need to be creative and try new approaches has come out strongly through the feedback we have gathered and this will be reflected in our planning.
Getting this plan right is key to our collective success. We don’t have all the answers so we welcome our communities’ input on how we can do this in the
most effective way.
The responses received to the recent further engagement on the Local Plan, which had climate as a key element of the conversation, is also relevant to the
long-term ambition of this plan. A report capturing the feedback from the further engagement on the Local Plan will be available shortly.

44Developing our collaboration networks
To be successful, change behaviours and impact on our carbon emissions it is important that we collaborate with as broad a spectrum of people as
possible. Diversity of thought will be a key enabler for us to realise our shared ambitions.
Who?
Residents
Staff, partners and contractors
Voluntary sector
Businesses
Community groups
Visitors
People who work in Kingston
Environment groups
Councillors & MPs
Students (school, college, university)
Citizen’s Assembly members
Strategic Partners
Young people not in education or employment
Health partners
To collaborate with these identified groups and individuals we will:
●
Develop an initial plan for each
●
Raise awareness of what we are doing
●
Link in with the community to ask for suggestions
●
Target specific groups who will be able to offer a different
perspective
●
Utilise the website and Lets Talk portal
●
Get out and about and meet people
Over the life of this programme we will continue to re-prioritise actions, based on funding availability, technology, effectiveness and your views. We are
looking forward to working together with our community to tackle climate change in our borough and identifying creative ways of approaching the challenge.

44Financing action
The council faced several financial challenges in the medium to longer term - even before the COVID-19 outbreak, which has further added to these
challenges. The economic and financial consequences of the pandemic, growing demand for services, and limited government grant funding make it
difficult to find adequate funds to meet the borough's needs. Despite these challenges the council has a drive and commitment to ensure it is doing the best
for residents and communities. We must maintain a focus on attracting green funding to the borough, like we have done successfully in the past, for
example with our “Go Cycle” project. We aim to ensure that Kingston is “funding ready” and able to take advantage of grants and low-cost loan funding to
enable us to take the action required to become carbon neutral. We will also review our own processes, such as collection and distribution of the Carbon
Offset Fund to ensure that local carbon reduction activities are delivered.
The financial challenges associated with tackling Climate Change are not unique to Kingston. A recent report commissioned by the Mayor of London
outlines an ambition for the whole of London to be carbon neutral by 2030. In that report there is reference to c£75b of funding required to meet that level of
ambition and at this time that funding has not been identified or confirmed.
Funding will inevitably be a key enabler for our action plans. We will need to strike a balance between our level of ambition, capacity, and funding to ensure
that we prioritise our delivery activity where we can achieve the greatest impact. As we move forward this will be a key consideration and will require regular
review to ensure that we are accessing all available funds and progressing the right things at the right time. Some of the action plans will be wholly reliant
on funding being made available and where funding is not made available we will recast our plan. Our plans are iterative and will continue to be responsive
to change in the wider system.
Understanding the financial implications for the actions will be managed through the governance and reporting processes that will be implemented moving
forward.

Governance
The size and scale of the climate change activity requires strong governance. However, this becomes more complex with multiple stakeholders and a
broader role of influencing rather than controlling. The action plans are cross cutting with multiple owners and in some instances, no defined owners. This
therefore will require a governance approach that is sufficiently flexible and acknowledges these challenges. The governance will need to:
●
Drive ownership to ensure that there is shared accountability;
●
Monitor and track progress against plan;
●
Enable accurate reporting of progress against carbon reduction target;
●
Enable escalation of identified risks at the appropriate level;
●
Enable decision making and activities to move at the appropriate pace without unnecessary bottle-necks;
●
Give transparent understanding of key interdependencies;
●
Identify unintended consequences of action plans and enable a quick response to rectify/reflect.
Council governance
Internal governance is within our control, however it is still complex due to the cross-cutting nature of the climate change programme.
●
Our plan is led by the Portfolio Holder for Environment and Sustainable Transport, in liaison with all of our Portfolio Holders, with oversight from our
councillor Climate Emergency Champion.
●
Through our internal steering group, we ensure that policy and major project decisions are made with Climate Action at the centre to facilitate
long-term change. This group is chaired by the council’s Executive Director for Corporate and Communities.
●
Much of the delivery activity sits within the relevant service areas.
The key to our success will be taking a long-term view in everything that we do, making decisions that will benefit our borough in the present and the future.
We will publish an annual report to show the progress and development of the Climate Action response, using our 2017/18 baseline to benchmark carbon
reduction. We will ensure that the costs associated with the delivery of this plan inform the council’s budget setting process and our ask of partners.

44Place-based governance
Place based governance requires a different approach as this is not totally within our control. The approach to this needs to be worked through, with
engagement from the community, key businesses, and relevant partners.
Some other local authorities have implemented a board – for example The One Kingston Climate Change Board (this name is not confirmed and is just a
suggestion at this stage) which has representatives from a variety of stakeholders. This board takes ownership and accountability for the delivery of the
place-based actions and is a forum for sharing and problem solving. This approach reinforces that it is not the responsibility of the council to deliver the
climate change ambition.
Terms of reference will require co production with our partners – agreeing the appropriate chair, regularity of meetings etc. A balance is needed to drive
momentum but to not put too much pressure on the different board members. It is important that we have broad representation on the board so that it is
able to influence different stakeholders in the community and share their learning and insight. A key next step will be considering how to share the
opportunity to get involved across the borough.
We have successfully taken a similar approach with our Transition to Green Economy group and we will take learning from this group as we move forward
and refine our approach.

Kingston’s updated Climate Action response
Following engagement feedback, we have refined the themes for action. The refined themes now more clearly differentiate between the focus required for
the council and then the wider place. The Sustainable Council theme contains all actions related to the council, the remaining themes are in relation to
Kingston as a place and the associated actions.
Page

44
Theme 1: Efficient Homes and Buildings
Our Efficient Homes and Buildings aim is to design, deliver and encourage energy efficient properties across the borough.
There are multiple ways that we can start to tackle this – from planning and development of new properties through to improving the efficiency of current
buildings, sharing information, and raising awareness. A critical aspect of this will be working together with the wider community to achieve our ambitions.
Lots of initiatives are already in progress with more due to begin shortly. A number of actions include developing strategies, approaches and options which
will require strategic decision making and this will impact on delivery timelines. Additionally, many of the actions within this plan will require significant
funding which will be a key consideration moving forward.
The actions in this section focus on:
●
Service offer and infrastructure
●
Ensuring sustainable development for future homes and buildings
●
Retrofit and improving energy efficiency in current properties
●

44Theme 2: How we travel
Travel impacts all of us and so it’s really important that the borough works collectively to move towards more sustainable
transport methods wherever we can. We will encourage pedestrians and cyclists and promote sustainable travel for our
residents, businesses and visitors, while freeing up space on our congested roads for people who really need to use cars with lower emissions.
The average daily flow of vehicles through our borough is significantly higher than the England average. While we are working hard to promote other modes
of transport, for those who need to drive we are keen to promote greener driving to reduce congestion and emissions and make our streets healthier, more
enjoyable places to be.
Lots of the actions within this plan are already underway and it is important to note that financial investment and detailed planning will be required. Changes
to the infrastructure, working across partnerships and encouraging changes in behaviour all take time.

Our target centres on reducing carbon emissions in Kingston. However, we are committed to delivering against
both
the
climate emergency
and
the ecological emergency. It
is important to have a theme focusing on protecting our natural
environment for future generations.
We will support, develop and empower community activity to increase nature conservation projects, develop further tree planting and rewilding schemes
and deliver a new biodiversity action plan through the biodiversity partnership. We will also implement planning guidance to enhance biodiversity in new
developments.
A number of these actions include developing strategies and monitoring performance. This will directly inform further actions for this plan, along with the
coproduction activity with our partners and communities.
The actions in this section focus on:
●
Our service offer and approach to delivery
●
How we aim to protect and enhance our natural environment
●
Ensuring sustainable development through appropriate planning
●
Working together with our partnerships and communities

44Theme 4: Waste Reduction
We are proud of the recycling rates in Kingston - in 2021 our rate was 47.6%. However, good recycling rates only tell part of
the story. We aspire to be a borough that takes more responsibility, reusing and borrowing rather than buying and disposing.
We continually encourage residents and businesses to limit their impact on the environment by reducing the amount of waste they produce, reusing items
where possible and making the most of recycling services.
We are working with the South London Waste Partnership boroughs to set a strategy for all waste and recycling services from contract break points in
2025. As decisions are made in relation to this activity the expectation is that more actions will be captured as part of the evolving plan moving forward, with
carbon reduction as a focus.
The actions in this section focus on:
●
How we can continue to develop our service offer and infrastructure
●
Opportunities to encourage increased recycling
●
New initiatives and ideas around how we can all work together to do things differently to reduce waste

44Theme 5: Sustainable Council
Our estate is our biggest direct source of emissions, through the energy we draw from the grid, combustion of fossil fuel to
provide heat and through maintenance activities. Our core estate produces the equivalent of a kilogram of CO2 every 2.5
seconds of the working day and would take some 150,000 trees to offset. Our approach to decarbonising our estate is by reducing consumption first, then
electrifying assets, removing any need to burn fossil fuels, then ensuring that electricity we do buy, is green and renewable.
Property is a long-term asset, meaning sustainable, long-term decision making is key. We also have some unique assets, ranging from protected, grade II
listed buildings like Ancient Market Place, to care homes, public conveniences and everything in between. One size doesn't fit all, and a unique approach
will be taken for each asset.
In order to achieve our wider target, we have to drive energy efficiency and carbon reduction through all council business. This will involve changing how we
commission services to influence our supply chain, changing how we invest to influence the financial markets and changing how we work, day to day, as
employees of the Council. We have already taken many large actions in this area since declaration, but there is more to do.
A key element of the actions is in relation to strategy and policy. It’s important that these are defined and applied consistently. The detail of those policies
will impact on the next set of actions and associated timelines. It is then important to monitor and report against policies so that we are able to hold
ourselves to account and track progress.

A 'green economy' can be defined as one in which the economic value of protecting the environment is recognised and
economic growth does not negatively affect the environment.
Our aim is to transition to a carbon neutral economy by supporting our businesses to grow while reducing their carbon footprint, as well as attracting new
businesses to our Borough; and, facilitating our workforce to develop future-facing skills to enable full participation in the green economy. We are supporting
this through a ‘Transitioning to Green Economy’ working group involving key stakeholders in the borough.

44Theme 7: Everyone together
The climate challenge impacts on everyone in our borough and is a key concern for many of our residents. This has been
clearly highlighted through our consultation activity completed in 2021, which incorporate engagement sessions and a feedback mechanism through our
Lets Talk portal.
It is clear that this challenge can’t be overcome if we work in isolation. It is critical therefore that we take a joined up approach and work together as a
community to effect change. Responding to the feedback we have more clearly identified Everyone Together as a theme and the associated actions are
captured below. It is important to note that this theme will be closely linked and aligned to our overall engagement approach and you can refer to
Appendix
#
for more detail.
These actions are just the starting point. As we move forward the expectation is that these actions develop and evolve in response to ongoing feedback,
suggestions and learning from both our community and beyond. Some engagement strategies will be more effective than others and we will seek to test
new approaches, learn from them and co produce solutions and initiatives with our vibrant community. There is lots of activity happening beyond the council
and it’s important that those initiatives are recognised and celebrated.

Measuring and reporting
Many of the actions listed within the action plan are ongoing and they will progress over the coming years to make a significant contribution in the reduction
of Kingston’s carbon footprint or other aligned outcomes. It is important that these are effectively monitored and reported so that there is a good, shared
understanding of the progress that is being made.
Inevitably, some initiatives over the course of the programme will be more successful than others. This can only be fully understood and responded to
through effective monitoring. A transparent approach is key to building trust in the wider community – sharing successes and challenges at the appropriate
time. Learning from our experience and applying that to new initiatives and action plans with the ability to track and monitor local carbon reduction.
We continue to develop and define our approach to measuring progress in all areas and a key element of this will be how we report against that through our
governance processes. This becomes more complex with our enhanced focus on place-based actions.
We will develop a publicly accessible dashboard to measure progress against our carbon baseline, in order to prioritise and adapt our actions to
meet our council and borough targets.
The Council’s carbon baseline
The Council’s own carbon footprint has been measured in order to create a baseline against which we will assess progress of our actions. This measures
not just carbon dioxide but other emissions that contribute to climate change, known as greenhouse gases. Here this is expressed as tonnes of Carbon
Dioxide Equivalents (tCO2e).
We chose the year 2017/18 as our baseline in discussion with other London Boroughs as this was before Covid-19 and before most boroughs had declared
a climate emergency. This gives us a consistent year to measure progress against, using the Greenhouse Gas Accounting Tool
.

44The chart below shows the Council’s total greenhouse gas emissions for the baseline year of 2017/18, which is a total of 13,217 tCO2e. The emissions
cover the Council’s consumption of energy (electricity, gas, transport fuel) and water from the buildings and vehicles the Council uses and pays for. In
2019/20, these emissions had reduced to 11,721 tCO2e.

Kingston Carbon emissions
A
quick
look
at
the
data
shows
that
focusing
on
council
carbon
emissions
is
only
going
to
make
a
small
dent
in
emission
levels.
Nationally,
public
sector
emissions
as
a
whole
equate
to
only
4%
of
emissions
that
are
within
a
council’s
control.
An
action
plan
focused
on
emissions
from
the
transport
and
domestic sectors (i.e. those within a council’s influence) therefore provides a much greater opportunity.
Using publicly available data (extracted from Business Energy and Industrial Strategy BEIS government website) we are able to understand at a high level
the emissions for Kingston compared to our statistical neighbours and the national average. The graphs below show that Kingston is doing well in terms of
reduction in carbon emissions; and performing better than the National average and slightly behind the comparator councils.
This is a good starting point but highlights the need to do more in order to achieve the ambition for the borough. There is the opportunity to learn from
others in this space.

Analysing
the
sectors
measured
within
this
data
shows
that
emissions
generated
by
the
Public
Sector
and
land
use
are
performing
below
average,
when
compared
with
our
statistical
neighbours.
Additionally,
when
analysing
the
types
of
emissions
generated
within
Kingston,
the
data
tells
us
that
39%
of
emissions
are
generated
by
the
domestic
sector
and
39%
generated
by
the
transport
sector.
60%
of
emissions
in
Kingston
are
generated
by
businesses.
The council is able to influence these emissions by working effectively across the whole community.
Using this publicly available data and projecting this forward, if Kingston continues to generate emissions at the levels seen between 2005 and 2019, we
will reach net zero around 2044.

Next Steps
We
are
keen
to
accelerate
our
climate
change
programme
and
this
strategic
action
plan
update
sets
new
targets
of
2030
for
council-generated
emissions
and
2038
for
place-based
emissions.
Consideration
needs
to
be
made
as
to
how
the
benefits
of
the
existing
activities
included
in
our
action
plans
will
be
realised and, indeed, escalated, in order to meet our revised ambition.
Our next annual report will provide far greater clarity and detail around the action plan activity and how it will lead to a reduction in carbon emissions.
Moving forward, our activities to reduce carbon emissions will be more data led.

Appendix A - Our Carbon Baseline methodology
The Council’s carbon baseline has been measured using the Greenhouse Gas Accounting Tool
developed by
the Local Government Association and Local
3
Partnerships. We can use this approach to look at progress against our baseline over time.
We will be developing our approach to energy management and data capture during the life of this action plan, and as we gather more data our baseline
will continue to be updated.
We are using 2017/18 baseline data in order to be consistent with data collected by other London Boroughs and London Councils.
The total 13,216.67 tCO2e is broken down by scope as follows:
SCOPE 1 Emissions : Emissions arising from the council’s gas and fleet usage
Kingston Council’s (RBK’s) Scope 1 emissions are 4,507.27 tCO2e in total. Scope 1 covers gas and fleet related emissions associated largely with the
Council’s main properties and operations. In terms of gas related emissions, this category includes all Council owned and operated buildings and facilities
including educational facilities, such as adult education centres, car parks and other public parking, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure facilities operated
directly by the Council, parks and greenspaces and residential care homes.
Also included in Scope 1 emissions are those Council maintained schools, specifically the ones which are purchasing gas from Kingston Council’s main gas
provider i.e. 34 schools using gas in 2017/18. However, the number of schools buying gas through the council’s main provider will be reduced in the future
and we may not be able to monitor their gas consumption in a collective way. Emissions from housing communal areas, void properties and hostels
(temporary accommodation), which are purchasing gas from RBK’s main provider are also included in Scope 1.
In terms of the RBK fleet use emissions covered by Scope 1 include fleet vehicles related to special educational needs and disabilities, adults minibus miles
for Kingston only (no data for taxi services for service users or home visits from social care staff are included), housing-related vehicles and vehicles for
grounds and tree maintenance.
There is no available data for Waste Collection Fleet Fossil Fuel use in 2017/18, however data will be available from 2019/20.
SCOPE 2 - Carbon that is emitted from electricity usage in council buildings and street lighting

44Kingston’s Council’s Scope 2 emissions are 6779.53 tCO2e. Scope 2 covers carbon emitted from electricity usage in council buildings and street lighting.
Based on available data for 2017/18, 82% of the electricity emissions are from council buildings including Adult Educational facilities, car parks, cemetery
and crematorium, leisure facilities, parks, care homes, libraries, and community centres and halls. Also, it includes emissions from 34 schools, which
purchase electricity from the RBKs main supplier, and communal areas, void properties and temporary accommodation. The remaining 18% of Scope 2
emissions come from street lighting electricity including Illuminated bollards and signs.
SCOPE 3 - ‘Upstream’ and ‘downstream’ emissions from the delivery of council operations
Scope 3 emissions monitored in 2017/18 include:
●
Emissions from water used in council buildings, including Adult Educational facilities, public parking, cemetery and crematorium, leisure facilities,
greenspaces, care homes, libraries, community centres and halls and a number of schools. Emissions from water usage by schools and housing
(communal areas, void properties and hostels) are not included.
●
Carbon emissions resulting from energy lost through transmission and distribution from electricity used by the buildings
●
Emissions from business travel of staff
●
Emission from council leisure centres operated by third parties
Kingstons’ Scope 3 emissions, measured from available data were 2,001.44 tCO2e
.
Emissions from waste from
Council’s buildings and schools, staff
commuting, goods and services supplied, as well as capital goods (i.e. construction) are not included in the Scope 3 Emissions reported for 2017/18.
We have identified a need for more accurate information to measure all Scope 3 emissions and report them.

44Appendix B - London and National responses
Climate Change
There is a global consensus that climate change is happening. In 2015 the first ever universal, legally binding global climate change agreement, known as
the 2015 Paris Agreement, was adopted. This sets out a global framework to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2°C
and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C.
National Framework
In 2019, in the
2050 Target Amendment
, the UK Government
committed by law to achieving net zero carbon by 2050. In order to achieve this, they put in
place a series of measures including the ‘
Ten Point
Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution
’, and the
Energy White Paper: Powering our net zero future
.
In
December 2020 the Climate Committee also set out
The
Sixth Carbon Budget
, which describes the path to
net zero for the UK. The recommended pathway
requires a 78% reduction in UK emissions between 1990 and 2035 through four steps:
●
people and businesses to adopt low-carbon solutions (i.e. new cars and vans, boiler replacements in homes, buildings to be low-carbon, waste
reduction and circular economy, renewable electricity or hydrogen);
●
expansion of low-carbon energy supplies;
●
reducing demand for carbon-intensive activities (e.g. insulation of buildings, change in diets, fewer car miles and air-travel);
●
land and greenhouse gas removals (e.g. transformation of agriculture and restoration of peatlands).
The Sixth Carbon Budget report also stated that “more than half of the emissions cuts needed rely on people and businesses taking up low-carbon
solutions – decisions that are made at a local and individual level. Many of these decisions depend on having supporting infrastructure and systems in
place. Local authorities have powers or influence over roughly a third of emissions in their local areas.” We take that responsibility seriously and as such we
will continue to deliver outside the scope of our target wherever we can, influencing our supply chains, changing how we invest and working with partners
and local businesses to deliver a green economy.
London level Strategy and Governance
The Mayor of London recognising that London’s environment affects everyone who lives in and visits the city developed in 2017 the first
London
Environment Strategy
, which brought together approaches
to every aspect of London’s environment, integrating the following areas: air quality; green
infrastructure; climate change mitigation and energy; waste; adapting to climate change; ambient noise; and, low carbon circular economy. A set of
strategies and initiatives have been developed in order to address the causes of climate change and ensure London can adapt to a changing climate.
These include: Accelerate delivery of a cleaner, greener London through the
London Recovery Board
in the context
of London’s long-term recovery from

44the coronavirus crisis, with one of it’s missions to deliver a
Green New Deal
which seeks to tackle the climate and ecological emergencies and improve air
quality by doubling the size of London's green economy by 2030 to accelerate job creation for all. This can be enforced through the
Good Work for All
mission, the
London Plan 2021
provides a planning
framework for sustainable development, the
Energy
for Londoners programme
aiming to make
London’s homes warm, healthy and affordable, workplaces more energy efficient and accelate generation of local clean energy. At the same time, action is
taken to
divest London’s pension
funds from fossil
fuel industries and scale up green investments by pension funds, while organisations across sectors are
encouraged to follow.
London Councils have brought together its London Environment Directors' Network (LEDNet) and Transport and Environment Committee to publish a
Joint
Statement on Climate Change in 2019
. This has resulted
in 7 themes and associated targets that London Boroughs are signed up to, which are:
●
#1 Retrofit London: Retrofit all domestic and non-domestic buildings to an average level of EPC B. Lead borough: LB Enfield and LB Waltham
Forest
●
#2 Low carbon development: Secure low carbon buildings and infrastructure via borough planning. Lead borough: LB Hackney
●
#3 Low carbon transport: Halve road journeys made by petrol and diesel via combined measures that can restrict polluting journeys and incentivise
sustainable and active travel options. Lead borough: RB Kingston and City of Westminster
●
#4 Renewable power for London: Secure 100% renewable energy for London’s public sector now and in the future. Lead borough: LB Islington
●
#5 Reduce consumption emissions: Reduce consumption emissions by two thirds, focusing on food, clothing, electronics and aviation. Lead
borough: LB Harrow
●
#6 Build the green economy: Develop London's low carbon sector and green our broader economy. Lead borough: LB Hounslow
●
#7 Creating a resilient and green London. Lead borough: LB Southwark
In July 2021 LEDNet worked with a coalition of partners to produce a paper outlining why it is essential local authorities play a central role in the
Government's Net Zero Strategy and how the Government can start to work with local authorities;
‘Recognising
local authorities as key partners in the Net
Zero Strategy
’, the
blueprint for accelerating climate
action and a green recovery a the local level
