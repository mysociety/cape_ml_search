2 3Foreword
We are facing a climate and ecological emergency, the impacts of which are being felt globally and at 
a local level. Our climate is changing faster now than ever before. East Riding of Yorkshire has already 
witnessed the impacts of climate change on communities, with flooding events in 2007 and 2013, the 
damaging effects of coastal erosion and the increasing frequency of heatwave events. Just this year, 
the UK recorded its highest ever daytime temperature of 40.3°C. We are set to face continued rising 
temperatures, more extreme weather, warming oceans and rising sea levels. All these changes pose 
major risks to our health, economy, infrastructure, wildlife, energy security and food production.
There is no doubt that climate change poses a significant challenge which will require everyone to  
play their part to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience to the effects of climate 
change. As an organisation we have set a net zero target of 2050 and we will look to build on our 
successes in environmental management and carbon reduction. This strategy details how we will do 
this, setting out the Council’s approach to tackling climate change across the East Riding. It reaffirms our 
commitment of having climate change as a key council priority, as reflected in our Business Plan 2020-
2025, and builds on our vision of Your East Riding... where everyone matters . 
Beyond the Council’s own carbon footprint, our ambition is to inspire residents and businesses to 
consider the environment and make efforts to reduce their own impact on the climate. We recognise 
that achieving our vision will not be easy, however, through collaborative action and partnership work  
we will be able to deliver positive climate action. Whether actions are big or small, every action counts 
as we continue to face the challenges of climate change together.

4 5Executive Summary 
“East Riding of Yorkshire will be net zero carbon and climate resilient. It will be a 
healthier and cleaner area supported by renewable energy, sustainable transport and 
underpinned by a strong local green economy. We will create an environment for people 
and nature to thrive, helping lead the way to a fairer and more equitable society”.
The Climate Change Strategy 2022 - 2030 establishes the vision for how East Riding of Yorkshire 
Council will reduce carbon emissions and build resilience to climate change. It details the overarching 
climate change response for the Council, building on the suite of plans already in place for mitigation 
and adaptation across the authority and the wider region. The strategy sets out key priorities and 
opportunities for climate action across the East Riding, which have been shaped by analysis of local  
data, expertise across the authority, feedback from our key partners and an initial public consultation.
The strategy takes an integrated approach to climate change, considering how we become more resilient to 
the changing climate (climate adaptation) and how we can reduce our impact on the climate (climate mitigation). 
We recognise that although as a Council we are only directly responsible for an estimated one per cent of 
carbon emissions in the area, we can use our influence to reduce emissions across the wider East Riding.
The Climate Change Strategy has been designed to set the East Riding on a path to net zero by 
establishing a flexible road map which can be developed over time as new policies and strategies are 
introduced that impact our ambitions. It has been developed to cover the period 2022 - 2030 with the 
aim to kick start rapid action, to reduce emissions and build resilience. During this time, we will focus our 
efforts on quick win actions (those with the greatest impact or that are the most feasible). This flexible 
approach will enable us to reassess our position in 2030, and ensure the strategy remains aligned with 
evolving policy, legislation, and technological changes.
We have set a net zero target of 2050 for our own operations and services and plan for this strategy 
to be a launch pad for exploring a shared area-wide net zero target. An area-wide target should be 
developed collaboratively with residents, businesses and organisations from across the area to create  
a shared target and ownership. We will also seek to review our target to align with an area-wide 
science-based target where possible. 
A more detailed action plan, outlining immediate plans and projects aligned to the strategy, will be 
developed covering the period 2022 - 2025. Following this, the action plan will be reviewed and updated 
every five years. Climate action will be monitored annually and will be scrutinised at regular meetings 
of Environment and Regeneration Overview and Scrutiny Sub-Committee. Updates will be provided 
through the Council’s Environmental Statement. Our Vision East Riding of Yorkshire will be net zero carbon and climate resilient. It will 
be a healthier and cleaner area supported by renewable energy, sustainable transport and 
underpinned by a strong local green economy. We will create an environment for people and 
nature to thrive, helping lead the way to a fairer and more equitable society.Climate

Introduction 
In 2019 East Riding of Yorkshire Council established a review panel to understand the risks and 
opportunities presented by climate change. The recommendations of the panel were published in 
February 2021 and, in line with national government, the Council declared a climate emergency.
The panel concluded that the Council should develop a Climate Change Strategy to co-ordinate our 
response to climate change and define our ambitions and vision for the future. This strategy aims to fulfil 
the review panel recommendations and help to understand our impacts on the climate. The strategy will 
outline how the authority will play its part in tackling the climate crisis as well as supporting our partners, 
businesses and residents to do the same. 
Climate change will impact everyone; however, our young people will have to live with the consequences 
for much longer. Young people across the East Riding have expressed their fears around climate change 
and are urging us to do more to protect their future.
“Our generation is the first to feel the impacts of climate 
change and the last generation that can do something 
about it.” 
Barack Obama (Former President of the United States of America).
Our climate continues to change rapidly, and we must all play our part to prevent further damaging 
warming. Globally, emissions of carbon dioxide must be halved by 2030 if we are to keep warming to  
1.5°C. By working together across all sectors of society this challenging target can be met. The chair of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (a body that brings together climate scientists from across 
the globe) said that:
“We are at a crossroads. The decisions we make now can 
secure a liveable future. We have the tools and know-how 
required to limit warming.”
Hoesung Lee (Chair, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).
Climate change will lead to warmer temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, sea level rises and  
more frequent and intense heatwaves and flooding events. Even when we dramatically reduce our 
greenhouse gas emissions, we will still be left with a warmed climate that we’ll need to learn to live with. 
This strategy will consider how we can reduce our impact on the climate and adapt to the inevitable 
changes we will see in the future. 
8 9Global and National Context 
International and national bodies, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and 
the UK Committee on Climate Change (CCC) have given clear messages that Governments are not 
yet doing enough to tackle climate change, but that there is a viable way to achieve net zero and avoid 
the worst impacts of climate change. We are currently on course for 3 - 4°C of warming but with a 
concerted international effort and investment, limiting warming to 1.5 - 2°C is possible, as per the  
United Nations Paris Agreement. 
Climate change cannot be tackled in isolation. The 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,  
of which climate change is one, show that there are many factors that influence the health and 
prosperity of people and the planet. 
The UK has a world leading Climate Change Act which sets out our national ambition to be net zero  
by 2050 and contains budgets for the amount of carbon we are able to release into the atmosphere.  
We have already seen significant progress to reduce our emissions. From the year 1990 we have reduced 
emissions by nearly 50 per cent and by 2030 we are on track to achieve a 68 per cent reduction. 
In 2021, the UK’s Net Zero Strategy was published setting out policies and proposals for decarbonising 
all sectors of the UK economy to meet the national net zero target of 2050.
Regional Context 
In November 2021 the Yorkshire and Humber Climate Commission published the first ever climate 
action plan for the region. The action plan has been developed to encourage shared responsibility 
for climate action, and makes the case for significant, tangible actions to tackle the climate 
emergency. The plan highlights the need to move beyond targets and planning, to action  
and delivery, calling for climate and ecology to be placed at the heart of decision making. 
A fundamental aspect of the plan is the importance placed on building resilience to 
the changing climate (sometimes called being climate ready, or climate adaptation). 
Over recent years a considerable amount of emphasis has been placed on 
reducing our carbon emissions, and other greenhouse gases, to limit warming. 
The Yorkshire and Humber Climate Action Plan recognises that even when 
emissions are cut the climate will still change and we need to be prepared 
and take action to protect our way of life. 
The action plan details a framework for change and 50 actions 
that will focus climate action across the Yorkshire and Humber 
region. The plan focuses on building a fair and just transition 
and to build the region’s resilience against climate 
disasters. It also sets a target to achieve net zero by 
2038 and specifies the need for “significant progress” 
by 2030.
Climate Change Impacts in the East Riding 
It is expected that, as time goes on, the East Riding will experience wetter winters, drier summers, higher 
sea levels and more extreme heatwaves. These climatic changes are likely to have significant impacts on 
society, the economy and environment within the East Riding by exacerbating existing risks and introducing 
new risks. This section provides an overview of the most significant climate-related risks to the East Riding. 
FLOODING  - The East Riding is already highly vulnerable to flooding. It is ranked within the top ten areas 
in the country with the highest number of homes at risk of river and tidal flooding, while surface water 
flooding is a widespread and growing risk, especially in urban areas of the county. Furthermore, almost 60 
per cent of the population within the Hull and East Riding catchment of the Humber River Basin District 
(HRBD) are currently at risk from flooding. With more extreme storms and a 20 - 30 per cent increase in 
winter rainfall as a result of climate change by 2100, the frequency and severity of surface water and fluvial 
flooding in the East Riding is likely to increase. Similarly, sea levels are expected to rise by up to one meter 
by 2100, leaving low-lying areas of the East Riding at significantly increased risk from tidal flooding. 
COASTAL CHANGE  - The majority (48km) of the East Riding coast is made up of soft glacial boulder 
clay. As a result, the East Riding has one of the fastest eroding coastlines in Europe, with average erosion 
rates of up to four metres a year and individual losses of over 20m recorded. Based on these rates 
continuing, approximately 209 residential properties would be lost to the sea within the next 100 years 
along with businesses, caravans, transport links and utilities infrastructure. However, rising sea levels 
and increased storminess linked to climate change are expected to result in higher rates of erosion and 
therefore greater impacts on communities and businesses. 
HEATWAVES  - By 2100 it is expected that mean summer temperatures in the East Riding will be 3 - 4 
degrees Celsius hotter than today. They are also expected to be drier, with more frequent and more 
extreme heatwaves. Such temperature rises not only have an impact on how we live our lives but can 
also have a significant effect on public health through heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heatstroke and 
hyperthermia. This impact is often felt worst by vulnerable residents, including those over 65, who make 
up a higher-than-average proportion (26 per cent) of the East Riding’s population.
While those impacts explored above are of particular importance for the East Riding, and therefore 
prominent in this strategy, it is important that plans are made to mitigate and adapt to all impacts of 
climate change. Some additional potential impacts, as outlined in the most recent UK Climate Change 
Risk Assessment include risks to:
 The viability and diversity of habitats and species.
 Soil health from increased flooding and drought.
 Natural carbon stores and sequestration from  
 multiple hazards, leading to increased emissions.
 Supply of food, goods and services duel to  
 climate-related collapse of supply chains and  
 distribution networks. Crops, livestock and commercial trees. 
 The UK from climate change impacts overseas. 
 People and the economy from climate-related  
 failure of the power system.

Cross Cutting Themes
This section outlines the cross-cutting themes which underpin the Climate Change Strategy.  
Solutions to meet the challenges of climate change should, where possible, also tackle the challenges of 
the broader societal issues faced in the East Riding of Yorkshire, including the rural nature of the area, 
health and wellbeing and inequalities. 
                 East Riding Rurality 
The East Riding is predominantly a rural area, with 44 per cent of residents living in dispersed rural 
communities. Rural areas face a different set of challenges to that of urban areas especially when tackling 
climate change. Some of those challenges faced by our residents include limited availability of public 
transport, or access to suitable employment. The rural nature of the area also poses challenges to the 
Council, for example, we need more vehicles and crew to complete waste collection rounds. 
Like many areas across the UK the East Riding has a broad range of household income levels, however 
there are pockets of deprivation in places. Increasingly, the population in the East Riding is becoming 
older, due to a high percentage of people retiring to the area. Deprived populations and elderly people 
are more likely to suffer from the impacts of climate change as they have less resilience to severe 
weather events. 
Whilst the landscape and demographic of our area is a strength and presents many opportunities, 
current economic uncertainties, major policy changes and continuing downward pressure on public 
sector finances are presenting rural communities with numerous challenges and climate change is only 
adding to these pressures. We have identified where challenges, opportunities and actions relate to  
the rural nature of the East Riding of Yorkshire (in appendix 2) using the symbol above.341,173  PEOPLE LIVE IN THE EAST RIDING OF YORKSHIRE

12 13                East Riding Coast
The East Riding of Yorkshire is not only rural, but is also defined by its coast, stretching from 
Flamborough Head in the north to Spurn Point in the South, a total of 53 miles. The 120-metre-high 
chalk cliffs, stacks, caves, and coves at Bempton and Flamborough Head support large numbers of 
seabirds such as puffins, gannets and kittiwakes which together form the UK’s largest mainland breeding 
seabird colony. Several major settlements are located along our coastline (including Bridlington, Hornsea 
and Withernsea) and have a significant part to play in the prosperity of the area, with fishing, offshore 
developments and tourism forming a key part of the region’s economy. Tourists visit the area specifically 
for our coastal towns, long sandy beaches and wildlife experiences. The areas connectivity with the 
Humber Estuary and wider marine environment also means that it is perfectly placed to support a  
broad range of coastal industries. 
The coast and its wildlife are, however, already experiencing the impacts of climate change, and it will 
be necessary to redress our relationship with the natural environment whilst also securing economic 
growth. There are many opportunities and challenges linked to our coastline, and a number of climate 
actions will link to the coastal nature of the East Riding of Yorkshire. These will be identified within the 
strategy (in Appendix 2) using this symbol above.                Health Implications of Climate Change 
It is widely acknowledged that the risks from climate change will affect everyone. Some will be affected 
more than others. The people whose health is being harmed first, and to a greater degree than the 
wider population, are often the people who contribute the least to climate change. People in low-income 
households and disadvantaged communities are often hit first and the hardest. The diagram below, 
created by World Health Organisation (WHO), provides an overview of climate-sensitive health risks, 
their exposure pathways and vulnerability factors.

14 15These climate-sensitive health risks are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, 
including women, children, ethnic minorities, low-income households, migrants or displaced persons, 
older populations, and those with underlying health conditions. Health impacts of climate change will be 
determined by how vulnerable and resilient people are and how quickly society can adapt to the changes 
we see. Climate change is also expected to increase the pressures on our healthcare systems.
Most action we take on climate change will impact health, therefore, as part of the development of this 
strategy a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) has been carried out. The assessment picks out some of the 
positive and negative impacts of climate change and highlights steps that can be taken to minimise  
or maximise the effects respectively. 
The strategy will seek to act on the recommendations contained within the HIA either within our action 
plan following implementation of this strategy, or via relevant Council strategies and policies. The health 
symbol above will note those areas where health is a consideration within the challenges / opportunities 
or actions.
             Inequalities and Climate Change 
Certain social groups are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, for example,  
single parent households and carers (who are disproportionately female), disabled people and the 
elderly. The root causes of their vulnerability lie in the intersectionality of their geographical locations, 
their financial and socio-economic circumstance, and their cultural and gender identity, in addition to 
their access to services and decision making. 
The most vulnerable can also be disproportionately impacted by climate change mitigation measures, 
which can place a higher financial burden on low-income households. For example, decisions that  
expand public transport or carbon pricing may lead to higher public transport fares which can have  
a greater impact on low-income groups.
East Riding of Yorkshire residents have been included in the decision-making process for the Climate 
Change Strategy. The strategy has been developed and implemented with transparency and provides 
easy access to information. 
The Council is keen to regularly consult with vulnerable residents on the issue of 
climate change to ensure that the strategy is inclusive and mitigates / maximises 
any negative / positive impacts respectively, and that any measures are taken to 
ease the burden on protected groups as far as possible. The symbol above will 
indicate (in Appendix 2) those areas where equality is a consideration within the 
challenges / opportunities or actions.
“Climate change is the biggest 
health threat facing humanity.”
(World Health Organisation (WHO)).
16 17Links to Other Strategies and Policies 
The Climate Change Strategy will set the overarching direction of travel and identify key opportunities 
for action to tackle climate change across the East Riding. It will form part of a suite of plans, policies  
and strategies that contribute to climate action. 
The diagram below highlights the interdependencies between the Climate Change Strategy, other Council 
plans and strategies and those of key partners, with all of these contributing to climate action across the 
East Riding. Examples of other regional plans and strategies supporting and delivering climate action are

Area-wide Carbon Footprint
The estimated carbon footprint of the East Riding of Yorkshire was 3,217.9 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (kt CO2e) in 2020 (BEIS, 2022). For reference, the Yorkshire and Humber region collectively 
produced 36,938.7 kt CO2e, in the same year, and the carbon footprint of England was 291,134.6 kt 
CO2e. Please note we will endeavour to continually update this data in alignment with  
the release of emissions statistics by Government.
To identify priorities for climate action we need to understand where our emissions come from.  
The chart below shows the main sources of emissions in the East Riding, breaking it down into key 
sectors. These are the latest estimates of the territorial emissions produced by Government, where 
emissions are allocated according to the point where that energy is consumed. This does not account  
for emissions from imported goods into the East Riding.

18 19The industrial sector produces a large proportion of the emissions in the East Riding, despite a reduction 
in emissions over recent years. The region is nationally recognised for its industry and manufacturing, 
particularly around the Humber Estuary. The industrial cluster in the Humber region emits more emissions 
than any other UK cluster and accounts for a large proportion of the total emissions in the East Riding. 
Emissions from road transport have only marginally declined since 2005 and remain a large part of the 
total emissions in the East Riding. This is because, despite improvements in vehicle efficiency and clean 
technology, these gains have been offset by an increase in road traffic. 
Notably, there has been a 64.6 per cent reduction in emissions from electricity in the East Riding 
from 2005 - 2019. This is largely due to an increase in renewable energy capacity contributing to the 
decarbonisation (less carbon used to produce electricity) of the national electricity grid. This is alongside 
phasing out the use of carbon intensive fuel sources like coal, which have contributed to the overall 
reduction in residential and industrial emissions in the East Riding. 
The agriculture sector also produces a large proportion of the area’s emissions. These emissions arise 
primarily from livestock, urea application, liming of soils and fertiliser application.
Not all the emissions we produce in our daily lives are captured in the data above, because carbon 
emissions are produced from the products we purchase and consume like food and drink, clothes,  
shoes, consumer electronics and appliances. Each product that is purchased has a carbon footprint, 
which will depend on how the product is sourced, prepared and transported during its lifecycle. 
It is estimated that in the East Riding the emissions produced from food and diet, along with the 
consumption of goods and services (including leisure and entertainment activities) per household is 
similar to the UK average household. Changing personal daily habits and what we consume can help 
tackle climate change. 
The Council’s Carbon Footprint
The estimated carbon footprint of East Riding of Yorkshire Council was 29,875 tonnes of carbon  
dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2020 - 21. 
The Council, one of the largest unitary authorities in the country, is responsible for a large array of 
property and infrastructure assets and provides public services to an area of over 930 square miles. 
The Council directly accounts for approximately one per cent of the total carbon footprint of the East 
Riding of Yorkshire. This includes the total emissions from assets that are owned or managed by the 
Council including buildings, schools, streetlights and transport (the Council’s fleet vehicles and business 
travel). The following chart below illustrates the relative contribution of these asset groups to the 
Council’s overall carbon footprint, using the most recent data we have available. The Council holds data 
on carbon emissions back to 2007 / 08. Since then, buildings have always been the largest contributor 
to the overall emissions, contributing over a third in 2020 - 21 (36.1 per cent). This is followed closely by 
transport (34.2 per cent). Carbon emissions from schools has reduced over time reflecting the energy 
improvements as a result of planned maintenance schemes and grid decarbonisation. Street lighting 
accounts for just 6.1 per cent of emissions and has seen reductions overtime as a result of upgrades 
from inefficient discharge lamps to high efficiency LED lamps. Buildings

Schools  
23.6%Street  
Lighting  
6.1%Since 2007 - 08 the Council has reduced its total carbon emissions by 27.5 per cent. This has been  
the result of the Council’s carbon reduction initiatives and having an Environmental Policy process  
that delivers environmental improvements, demonstrated through our ISO14001:2015 accreditation.  
Major external factors have also contributed to this including the decarbonisation of the electricity grid. 
The Council’s Carbon and Energy Management Strategy found that whilst the Council’s carbon emissions 
are predicted to decrease in the short-term, due to the decarbonisation of the electricity grid, the 
Council will fail to meet the Climate Change Committee’s (CCC) fourth and fifth carbon budget targets 
later this decade. To meet these, the Council will have to significantly increase investment in carbon and 
energy reduction technologies and set relevant policies to reduce the authority’s carbon footprint. 
More data would support further understanding of the emissions we produce. In particular,  
the emissions that occur indirectly as a result of the Council’s activity. These are often referred to as 
scope three emissions and usually represent 70 - 80 per cent of a local authority’s total emissions. 
Typically, these relate to the emissions associated with the things we buy (procured goods and services), 
out sourced contracts and staff commuting. As part of our carbon monitoring and reporting we will 
explore ways to capture these emissions and set subsequent reduction plans. 
20 21Future Pathways 
The Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research have calculated carbon budgets for each of the local 
authority areas in the UK. This helps local authorities understand the contribution they must make 
towards the Paris Climate Change Agreement. The carbon budget sets out the maximum amount of 
carbon dioxide that can be emitted in a local area to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees compared to 
pre-industrial levels. With no change to the current emissions produced, it was predicted that the East 
Riding of Yorkshire would use its carbon budget by 2026. 
We have undertaken a study to further understand the various pathways to achieve net zero.  
The research suggested that to align with a Science Based Target of 1.5 degrees, the East Riding of 
Yorkshire will need to achieve net zero emissions by 2044. 
The challenge for achieving this target should not be underestimated and will require significant changes 
to the way our energy system operates and fundamental lifestyle changes. Even if we follow the more 
ambitious pathways presented by the National Grid or Northern Power Grid, this may not achieve the 
net zero goal by 2044 and would require offsetting of residual emissions, which should always be a last 
resort. This is presented as the ‘Leading the way’ scenario on the graph below. 
According to study we had commissioned, this scenario would require as a minimum a: 
Measuring progress on climate adaptation is more challenging, primarily because the impacts of climate 
change are so varied and are changing all the time. 
Nationally, the Government is required to produce a five-yearly climate change risk assessment,  
which helps set the National Adaptation Programmes, with the next set for 2023. The Climate 
Change Committee produces an assessment (every two years) of the UK Government’s progress with 
adaptation. The most recent report found that action on adaptation has failed to keep pace with the 
worsening reality of climate risk and acting sooner will save more resources rather than waiting to deal 
with the consequences. 
Locally, we continue to monitor and track elements of climate risk in the East Riding across our different 
work streams and partnerships. This includes: 
• A programme to assess the levels of risk from coastal erosion, which includes twice yearly aerial  
 image and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys of the whole East Riding coastline. 
• A series of assessments and studies to improve understanding of surface water flood risk,  
 test the effectiveness of flood mitigation works and record the condition of flood defence structures.  
 This includes our cutting-edge approach to produce ‘baseline’ integrated computer models of the  
 area’s drainage catchments, which we can overlay with rainfall and tide level data to simulate  
 combined sources of flooding. 
• Our emergency planning team regularly update and share an assessment of the major risks we face in  
 the East Riding, including those from climatic and weather events, so the core responders can plan  
 and prepare for emergencies as necessary. 
• Measuring progress with partnerships, such as the Humber Resilience Forum and the Regional Flood  
 and the Yorkshire Regional Flood and Coastal Committee (RFCC). 
Whilst we have these procedures in place for measuring climate risk, we will continue to undertake 
research to further understand all the risks from climate change, estimating the costs of achieving climate 
resilience and how the Council can support residents and businesses with adaptation measures.78%

22 23What is Important to our Residents?
Initial Public Consultation
Recognising that early engagement was critical to the development and success of the Climate Change 
Strategy, East Riding of Yorkshire Council utilised the online engagement platform, Commonplace, to 
better understand public opinion on climate change in the local area. The consultation took place between 
November 2021 and February 2022. We had 300 responses and the results are highlighted below. 
We found the key climate priorities for respondents, in order of popularity, were:
Transport and Air Quality  | Trees and Green Space | Buildings and Home  
 Energy Supply  | Community Action
We also found the top priorities for driving climate action, in order of popularity, were:
Political leadership  | Community Involvement  | Funding  
Education and Awareness  | Transparency
Some of the other frequently mentioned topics outside of the set questions of the survey were:
Electric vehicle infrastructure.
Electrification of the rail network.
More engagement with residents on climate change and the environment.
Supporting active travel.
We have worked with members of the Youth Parliament, the Regional Youth Climate Action and  
East Riding Voluntary Action Services to hear what our young people think about their future and  
more specifically climate change. Climate Change was a key priority for candidates for the youth 
parliament. East Riding of Yorkshire Council will support young people to have their say on how  
climate change is addressed. 
East Riding of Yorkshire Council recognises the importance of individual actions and those of community 
groups, businesses and partner organisations. Consultation and engagement will remain  
an important tool for the delivery of the Climate Change Strategy. 
The views of residents have been considered when developing the Climate Change Strategy. An eight 
week consultation was completed between August and September 2022. Updates have been made to 
the strategy to reflect the feedback received. 
24 25Our Approach 
The Climate Change Strategy outlines the approach that East Riding of Yorkshire Council will use to 
reduce carbon emissions and build resilience to climate change. It is designed to set the East Riding on 
a path to net zero by establishing a flexible road map which can be added to over time as new policies 
and strategies are introduced that impact our ambitions. 
The strategy will take an integrated approach to climate change, considering how we become more resilient to 
the changing climate (climate adaptation) and how we can reduce our impact on the climate (climate mitigation). 
The strategy has been developed to cover the period 2022 - 2030 with the aim to kick start rapid action to 
reduce emissions and build resilience. During this time, we will focus our efforts on quick win actions (those 
that make big carbon savings or are simple to implement). We’ll also develop our data to ensure we have 
the best information on which to base future decisions. This approach will enable us to reassess our position 
in 2030, and ensures the strategy remains aligned with evolving policy, legislation and technological changes.Scope
East Riding of Yorkshire Council recognises that although as an authority we are only directly responsible 
for a small proportion of the emissions in East Riding, we can use our influence to reduce emissions 
across the wider East Riding. This strategy has been developed to cover three broad areas of our work. 
• East Riding of Yorkshire Council directly reduces carbon emissions and takes action to adapt to the  
 changing climate. East Riding of Yorkshire Council is directly responsible for just one per cent of  
 emissions in the East Riding.
• Indirect climate action will facilitate change through the services the Council delivers. East Riding  
 of Yorkshire Council is responsible for the delivery of many key services, such as planning, housing,  
 economic development, and waste. Estimates suggest that we might influence as much as 30 per cent  
 of the area’s emissions in this way.
• East Riding of Yorkshire Council works in partnership with other organisations, businesses and  
 communities and we will support climate action across the East Riding through collaboration.THE STRATEGY IS...
 Based on our current understanding and evidence which will develop and evolve over time. 
 Integrated. A strategy that sets aims for reducing emissions and building resilience to the  
 climate within the East Riding.
 A strategy that sets our priority areas for action to 2030.
 A plan that has been developed in collaboration with key partners and aims to reflect the  
 views of residents.
 Flexible. We will update this regularly to ensure that it aligns with evolving policy,  
 legislation and technological and market changes.
 A strategy that builds on the positive actions taken by the Council, its partners,  
 local businesses, and residents within the East Riding.
 A strategy that has sustainability at its core. We will strive to ensure actions represent a  
 sustainable solution to the challenges of climate change, making best use of resources and  
 having socio-economic benefits.
 Designed to support, coordinate, and facilitate climate action.
THE STRATEGY IS NOT...
 Perfect. The Council has led on the development of this strategy at pace, acting in line with  
 the climate emergency that we are facing. 
 A fixed path to achieving net zero. We will continue to review our strategy to ensure we are  
 still heading in the right direction.
 Enough on its own to meet our climate targets. Everyone must play their part. 
 A strategy that will dictate action. Instead, we hope to work with partners, businesses,  
 and our residents to establish the most suitable actions for the East Riding. Local Authority Sphere of Influence

The Climate Change Strategy proposes climate action to be taken across a series of eight broad priority 
areas. Although we recognise there is overlap between these areas, they are presented separately in the 
following pages. The priority areas are set out in the diagram below: 
Please note a detailed list of our areas for action within each of these priority areas can be

28 29Transport  
Transport is the sector that emits the most greenhouse gas emissions across the UK, accounting for 31.5 
per cent of carbon dioxide emissions in 2021. In the East Riding, the transport sector is second only to 
industry as the highest emitting sector, making up 22 per cent of all emissions within the East Riding of 
Yorkshire. Government has introduced a ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030, which will 
start to reduce emissions across the sector, but more work will be required. 
To achieve our net zero ambitions there will have to be a transition to low and zero emission vehicles,  
a modal shift towards active travel and public transport, and an avoidance of unnecessary travel through 
digital and rational solutions. As set out in the UK Government’s Transport Decarbonisation Plan, the 
electrification of road transport is only part of the solution; it is essential we avoid a car-led pathway to 
net zero and instead make public transport, cycling and walking the natural first choice for all who can 
take it. 
Reducing carbon emissions and improving healthy lifestyles is a key objective set out in East Riding of 
Yorkshire Council’s Local Transport Plan (2021 - 2039) which sets our transport funding priorities and 
solutions to help us meet net zero and increase climate resilience.
Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure
The Council’s strategic approach for the uptake of electric vehicles for the East Riding area is  
outlined in the ‘Public Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Strategy’, which forms part of the Council’s  
Local Transport Plan (2021-2039). The main aim of the Strategy is to support and encourage the 
use of electric vehicles (EV) by installing a basic network of charging points across the East Riding. 
Growth of our EV infrastructure is important as it gives people the confidence to visit the East  
Riding whilst boosting the economy at the same time. 
Through the Local Transport Plan, the On-street Residential Charge Point Scheme and other grants 
and development funding, the Council has successfully installed 15 twin socket 7kW chargers across 
our 14 main settlement areas. Since their installation the uptake in their usage has increased with all 
sites being used daily. 
The Council has committed to expand their EV infrastructure with a further 100 by April 2023, 
focussing on our settlement areas and where they can benefit both residents and visitors. Key Challenges and Opportunities
Challenges to Delivery
Addressing the heavy reliance on car travel - In East Riding, the distance between remote settlements 
and local services, coupled with higher-than-average car ownership, means there is estimated to be 
more trips made by car compared to other areas in the Yorkshire and Humber region.
Capital cost of electric vehicles  - The current market for ultra-low emission vehicles makes them 
unaffordable for many residents and businesses across East Riding. 
Funding  - There is currently insufficient funding to undertake all the proposed transport schemes set  
out in Council strategies, with reductions seen in funding from National Government for many areas  
of sustainable and active travel, including for our Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plans.
Rurality  - The East Riding of Yorkshire is predominantly rural which is a key factor for high car 
ownership rates and car use being the preferred mode of transport; these are fundamental challenges 
to reducing carbon emissions. This means community transport services and the electrification of road 
transport will be vital in our decarbonisation effort for these areas.
Impact of COVID -19 on public transport - The pandemic and social distancing has caused disruption  
to bus and rail patronage and industry forecasts suggest a recovery to previous levels will take years.
Opportunities
Encouraging healthy lifestyles - Encouraging and supporting active travel to reduce emissions, can help 
to reduce the negative effects of a sedentary lifestyle and reduce the likelihood of developing chronic 
health conditions and associated long-term healthcare costs.
Homeworking  - There is an opportunity to take advantage of the demand for homeworking across the 
East Riding, since the COVID -19 Pandemic, to reduce emissions associated with commuting.
Active travel opportunities - The rural scenic nature, flat landscape and compactness of East Riding’s 
large towns offer residents and visitors an enticing option to travel on foot or by bike.
Reducing congestion  - Schemes to encourage active travel and use of public transport will reduce traffic 
congestions by encouraging more people away from using the private car.
Uptake in cycling - The COVID -19 pandemic led to a change in travel patterns and an uptake of cycling 
across England. Cycling levels increased to the highest since national travel surveys were undertaken. 
There is a huge opportunity to capitalise on this at a local level.
30 31ENERGY
Transition away from fossil 
fuels and increase renewable 
energy production.
Smarter and more flexible 
energy system.Energy  
Although using energy in our homes is easy (we often push a switch to turn on a light), producing, 
transforming, transporting and distributing that energy across a region is a more complex and difficult 
task. All of this together is commonly described as our ‘energy system.’ Based on future scenarios of our 
energy system, if we are to meet net zero by 2050 or earlier, we would likely require the following: 
• A transition away from unabated natural gas. Some natural gas will be required for hydrogen  
 energy production in the short-term.
• An increase in renewable energy production, particularly wind and solar power. 
• To make more use of hydrogen energy, which will help with inter-seasonal flexibility  
 (when we cannot rely on solar and wind power). 
• An increase in the use of bioenergy (sourced from recently living organic materials),  
 and combined with carbon capture and storage, where possible, to create negative emissions.
• A mass transformation of how we consume energy with the electrification of home heating,  
 transport and industry. 
• Become smarter and more flexible in the way we use energy, balancing demand to reduce  
 peak energy requirements.
• Store energy more effectively and reduce energy waste.
East Riding of Yorkshire Council continues to take action to support the transition to a cleaner energy 
system and this priority area sets out how the Council can further support the ambitions listed above. 
Fundamental changes to the way we will consume energy such as the electrification of transport,  
heating buildings and industry are set out in more detail in other priority areas.
KEY AREAS
32 33Solar Farm at South Cliff Holiday Park
In 2021, the Council installed a 370kW solar farm at South Cliff Holiday Park, Bridlington,  
which generates zero carbon electricity that is supplied directly to the site, significantly reducing 
carbon emissions by 130 tonnes a year. This is equivalent to the carbon savings associated with 
powering 22 homes for an entire year. The renewable technology will provide 45 per cent of the 
site’s annual electricity usage. 
The Council owns and operates the large caravan park that supplies electricity to approximately  
900 static caravans and 250 touring caravan pitches, which is the Council’s second highest consumer 
of electricity. 
The shower blocks at the holiday park are also heated using ground source heat pumps to provide 
low carbon heating. They have solar thermal panels on the roof, which means much of the hot water 
used by holidaymakers has been heated by the sun. The site is recognised as one of the greenest 
holiday parks within the United Kingdom
Funded jointly by the Council and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the project in 
Bridlington was part of a wider array of green initiatives. The estimated total value of the investment 
in the solar farm and solar panels was £1,895,341, with the council contributing £1,047,365 towards 
the scheme.
Key Challenges and Opportunities
Challenges to Delivery
Natural gas  - Gas has long been promoted as a transition fuel as it has lower carbon emissions than coal, 
but still requires a similar scale of centralised infrastructure. As a result, we now have one of the most 
developed gas networks in the world. This makes the replacement or decarbonisation of the network 
a key challenge nationally, which is particularly significant given the Government’s commitment to phase 
out the installation of new gas boilers by 2035.
Costs  - Whilst we have identified opportunities for carbon reduction initiatives and energy projects, 
such as new solar farm projects or geothermal heating, the economic viability of projects on this scale 
are challenging. Rising electricity prices will lead to high running costs for electric vehicles and heat 
pumps meaning these technologies become less financially viable for businesses and residents.
Fossil fuel economy  - The Humber is home to many traditional heavy industries, such as oil refining 
and steel production, whose long-term future is under pressure from decarbonisation. Ensuring this 
economy remains sustainable during the transition to net zero is essential to the region. To overcome 
this challenge partners have come together to create a Humber Industrial Cluster Plan setting out a  
strategy to achieve net zero.Environmental impact  - We must use our natural resources sustainably and create new infrastructure 
which does not have negative impacts on the wider environment. For instance, offshore wind can 
negatively impact seabird populations which are already under significant pressure from climate change. 
As such, we need to plan energy infrastructure developments efficiently.
Opportunities
Hydrogen  - The Humber industrial area is leading on the development of hydrogen production and 
storage facilities to create one of the UK’s most efficient gas-fired power station and support the roll-out 
of low-carbon hydrogen infrastructure. Hydrogen has the potential to be blended into the gas network, 
used for domestic heating and power transportation.
Offshore wind  - The Humber region has been identified as a flagship region for wind power and will be 
key to achieving the Government’s offshore wind power targets. This is unsurprising given that region 
is recognised internationally for offshore wind energy with Ørsted’s Hornsea Project One, the largest 
offshore wind farm in the world, powering more than one million homes. Even larger offshore projects 
are in development, with most of the turbines manufactured at the Siemens Gamesa factory in Hull. 
Carbon capture and storage  - Major energy companies have come together to develop offshore carbon 
capture and storage in the North Sea, forming The Northern Endurance Partnership.  
This partnership provides the infrastructure needed to transport carbon dioxide from emitters in the 
Humber to secure offshore storage in the North Sea. In October 2021, this partnership’s East Coast 
Cluster was selected as a priority cluster in phase-one of the UK Government’s Carbon Capture,  
Usage and Storage cluster sequencing process. Once developed it will transport and store 50 per cent  
of all UK industrial cluster emissions. This will serve the Zero Carbon Humber project, aiming to 
establish a fully decarbonised industrial cluster on the Humber. 
Industrial clustering  - The Humber is just one of the six energy intensive industrial clusters in the UK. 
These industrial districts provide unique partnership opportunities for integrating processes, building 
more efficient supply-chains, utilising by-products or waste materials, and conducting research and 
development on low-carbon technologies.
Biomass  - The Yorkshire and Humber region is leading the way nationally in terms of biomass energy 
and fuel production. This includes the 22MW Solar 21 biomass plant in Aldbrough, the Y Pellets wood 
refinery near Goole and Drax power station in Selby, which is fuelled by compressed wood pellets.
34 35WASTEWaste  
Greenhouse gas emissions from waste management practices currently account for approximately five 
per cent of the territorial carbon footprint for the East Riding. These are mainly from methane released 
from landfill sites, with some also from waste-water treatment and the incineration of waste. In East Riding, 
a large proportion of our waste is classified as household, commercial, industrial, or agricultural waste. 
To reduce the carbon footprint of our waste activities in the East Riding, we will need to reduce how 
much waste we produce by keeping resources in use for as long as possible and prevent waste by  
re-using materials and products where possible. The waste hierarchy (below) is a useful guide for 
reducing emissions, prioritising action further up the hierarchy.
We also have an ambition to help East Riding become a circular economy. This means moving away from 
the linear process of taking materials from the earth, making products out of them, and throwing them 
away. We want to create a more cyclical process where materials flow, there is a focus on recovery or 
regeneration of resources, and we design products that can be made and made again. Based on what we 
use in our average daily lives across East Riding, over a third of our personal carbon footprint is from the 
purchase of goods (including food and diet).
The circular economy will require partnership action across all sectors of society, as a unitary local 
authority only has limited control over the full lifecycle of products and materials.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
Challenges to Delivery
COVID -19 pandemic  - This pandemic has brought new challenges to waste management, in particular the huge 
amount of extra medical waste produced. There are limitations on how this waste can be recycled or reused.
Commercial waste - The local authority has limited influence over the management of commercial 
waste, particularly if they do not use the Council’s collection service.
Control on production  - Many of the products we consume originate from outside the area,  
and even the country, meaning we have limited control locally over sustainability in the early stage  
of a products lifecycle.
Collection of waste - We are still awaiting clarity on national changes, through the Environment Act,  
for the collection of separate waste streams and the impacts this will have, particularly if food waste has 
to be collected separately from other compostable waste.
Transfer of waste - The transfer of commercial and industrial waste between companies and 
organisations for alternative or re-use is hampered by overly complex and restrictive waste legislation. 
Replacement products - There is limited capacity for the large-scale repairing of products, which means 
that it is more practical, and often cheaper, for individuals and organisations to purchase replacement 
products and dispose of faulty items, rather than repair them. 
Opportunities
Environment Act - This came into law in November 2021 and plans to extend producer responsibility for waste, 
create a deposit return scheme for single use drinks containers and further charges for single use plastics.
Saving money - Having sustainable waste management practices in place as an organisation can reduce 
the amount of waste your business produces, saving disposal costs.
Sustainability - As well as reducing carbon emissions, circular economy principles have wider sustainability 
benefits, including lowering demand on the finite resources we have available and reducing pollution like plastics.
Waste heat - With the large industrial sector we have on the Humber there is the potential to utilise 
the waste heat produced from industries to be made available for third parties, without it simply being 
discharged into the atmosphere.
Product efficiency information - Legislation has come into place, through the Environment Act,  
giving powers for Government to introduce new resource efficiency information on products,  
including labelling on the recyclability and durability of products.
Yorkshire Circular Economy  - Initiatives by organisations, such as CATCH, are working to establish a 
circular economy approach across the Humber Industrial Cluster, including the re-use of waste products. Bag Sorting at Household Waste Recycling Sites
A waste composition analysis at Household Waste Recycling Sites (HWRS) showed that up to 
30 per cent of bags of waste contained recyclables including textiles, cardboards and electricals. 
A project has been set up asking residents to pre-sort their waste. The aim is to ensure that only 
non-recyclables are placed in the general waste container. Residents who arrive with a mixed bag of 
waste are asked to visit the sorting table where they separate out any recyclables and place them in 
the bins provided. 
The initiative started at Driffield HWRS in March 2022 and has since been rolled out across all ten 
sites. At the Driffield site, there has been a five per cent increase in recycling rates since the scheme 
started. In the first two months over 40 tonnes less of non-recyclable waste was taken to the site, 
and nearly seven tonnes extra was diverted to recycling through the sorting area on site. 
Although the scheme hasn’t been in place across all sites for long, recycling rates across the HWRS 
have already increased by 3 - 5 per cent. The overall recycling rate for the HWRS is likely to be 82 
per cent for 2022 / 23. 
Free compost giveaways ran by East Riding of Yorkshire Council.
38 39ENVIRONMENTEnvironment  
At a local level we must support the sustainable use of land across East Riding meeting our  
objectives to support nature, people, and the climate. This must consider nature recovery,  
recreation, food production, renewable energy and creating high quality places to live. Whilst many  
of these types of land use are picked up through the Climate Change Strategy, this priority area focuses 
on three: nature, farming, and food systems.
There are fundamental links between the natural environment and climate change:
• Soils, forests, wetlands, peatlands, and oceans absorb and store carbon. Future emissions can be  
 cut through the maintenance of healthy ecosystems and restoring degraded environments.  
 However, damage to ecosystems can reduce their capacity to capture and store carbon. 
• Working with and enhancing nature can provide cost-effective and accessible solutions for climate  
 mitigation and adaptation.
• The climate is changing much faster than nature and wildlife can adapt to it. The pressures on natural  
 resources have led to an ecological crisis with species and habitats declining at an alarming rate.  
 The UK has experienced some of the highest rates of biodiversity loss in the world.
• The impact of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystems can exacerbate other pressures such  
 as pollution, over-exploitation, invasive species, flooding and habitat loss and fragmentation. 
Agriculture and the food sector will play a large role in the local and national climate response. In the 
East Riding, 18.6 per cent of emissions are produced from the agricultural sector, largely from livestock, 
fertilisers, and operational activity. Emissions linked to food and drink production and consumption more 
broadly can be related to supply chains, transportation, and waste. In East Riding, agricultural land makes 
up 90 per cent of the land area and supports over 2,000 farming and food manufacturing businesses, 
illustrating its importance to our economy and cultural identify.

40 41Humber Forest
Humber Forest is the community forest for the Hull and East Riding region. The team at East Riding 
of Yorkshire Council help landowners, farmers, businesses, and communities to transform their local 
environment through tree planting. Humber Forest can provide funding and practical help, making it 
both easy and effective, at no cost to the landowner. The initiative aims to promote joy and prosperity 
to communities through the act of tree planting to sustain the planet on which we depend. 
Tree planting provides many benefits to the environment and can reduce the effects of climate 
change locally and globally. Tree coverage across the East Riding and Hull Region is recognised as the 
lowest in England at 2.2 per cent. With this in mind, it makes planting projects like this one all the 
more important if we are to combat the effects of climate change.
Humber Forest has increased woodland coverage in this region during the 2021 / 2022 planting season 
by planting 17.37 hectares of trees / hedgerow / woodland. The goal for planting season 2022 / 2023 is 
to plant a further 88 hectares in the Hull and East Riding region, with more planned in future years.
For anyone interested in planting on their land, or who would like to find out more information, 
please visit www.humberforest.org  or contact humber.forest@eastriding.gov.uk 
Key Challenges and Opportunities
Challenges to Delivery
Invasive Non-Native Species (INNS) - Increasing summer temperatures could lead to an increase 
in non-native species colonising the area or being able to reproduce more successfully and thus 
potentially become invasive.
Marine environment  - Whilst some impacts of climate change in the marine environment are  
well-documented, the complexity of marine and coastal ecosystems means that data gathering  
and implementing management measures can be particularly challenging. 
Nature-based solutions  - Many nature-based solutions to manage flood and coastal change risk in 
East Riding are not suitable. Factors such as our coastline’s geology often prevents nature solutions  
to coastal erosion.Food price - Some of the sustainable and ethical food products can be more expensive, which can 
disproportionally affect those on low incomes.
Supply chains - Supporting the implementation of a sustainable and resilient food supply chain that 
extends across all aspects of the East Riding’s food network is a huge challenge, requiring change from 
outside the region.
Opportunities
Regenerative agriculture  - Technologies that regenerate and revitalise the soil and environment can 
help rebuild soil organic matter and restore degraded soil biodiversity, storing more atmospheric 
carbon and creating more resilient soils that can better withstand climate change impacts like flooding 
and drought.
The Agriculture Act  - This includes the Environmental Land Management Scheme, rewarding farmers 
for public goods, such as improving soil health, measures to reduce flooding and storing carbon.
The Environment Act  - In line with the requirements in the Environment Act, the Council will 
lead on the creation of a Local Nature Recovery Strategy that identifies opportunities for nature’s 
recovery and delivers wider benefits, including climate change mitigation and adaptation. We will 
also implement into our planning system a way to deliver measurable net gain improvements for 
biodiversity by creating or enhancing habitats in association with development.
Government Food Strategy - The national food strategy, published in 2022, contains an objective to 
deliver a sustainable, nature positive and affordable food system setting out this will only be achieved 
through a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of the food system.
COVID -19 - A survey undertaken by Natural England found that more than 40 per cent of people 
noticed that nature, wildlife and visiting local green and natural spaces has been more important to 
their wellbeing since the start of the pandemic in 2020. There is an opportunity to capitalise on this 
newfound appreciation for the natural environment.
Natural capital approach  - A natural 
capital approach allows the value of 
our natural resources to be included 
in decision-making. This includes both 
monetised goods (such as food and fuel) 
and the non-monetised services we 
receive (such as health and wellbeing 
benefits of spending time in nature). 
42 43Buildings  
Domestic properties in the East Riding account for approximately 18 per cent of the county’s 
greenhouse gas emissions. A priority for significantly reducing carbon emissions in East Riding is to 
retrofit the existing building stock with technology to produce low-carbon or renewable energy and 
ensure buildings can then retain this energy as efficiently as possible.
Typically, most of the energy used in homes is to heat space. Therefore, we will require a shift away from 
gas and oil central heating systems to heat pumps, biomass or hydrogen boilers (when commercially 
available) in our existing building stock. This will have to be coupled with measures to ensure buildings 
retain heat. Factors that determine whether a building retains heat include how it was built, how much 
insulation has been installed, the efficiency of the windows, how draughty it is and the behaviour of those 
who live there.
With provision to be made for 1,400 new houses each year, as set out in the East Riding Local Plan,  
we will have to transition towards these buildings being designed and built to zero carbon standards  
as soon as possible if we are to not contribute further carbon emissions as an area.

or G and fulfil an eligibility assessment of the property and income threshold. 
The principle aim of the scheme is to improve the energy performance of homes through the 
installation of a new air source heat pump as well as insulation and ventilation upgrades, which will 
help you to keep warmer throughout all your home. 
Reverends Vincent and Anne Lewis, whose Broomfleet property is off the gas network and had solid 
fuel heating, contacted the Council to have an air source heat pump system installed.
They said “We are very pleased with the air source heat pump system, it provides consistent heat 
throughout all of the house which has made a great improvement to the warmth of the whole of the 
property, without costing us anymore on our fuel bills. The installation of the air source heat pump was 
completed efficiently, excellent workmanship, customer service and how to use the system was fully 
explained to us. We would highly recommend having an air source heat pump installed to other people  
off the main gas network.”

Council’s Energy Efficiency at the email healthy.homes@eastriding.gov.ukKey Challenges and Opportunities
Challenges to Delivery
Gas network  - Approximately 32 per cent of properties in the East Riding are not connected to the 
mains gas. This means they rely on different heating fuels like oil or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) which 
are more carbon intensive and expensive compared to mains gas. 
Energy performance ratings  - Approximately 66 per cent of the properties in East Riding have an 
energy performance rating of D or below. The Government’s Heat and Buildings Strategy recognised 
that most homes below EPC band C will need to be upgraded between now and 2050. 
Fuel poverty  - According to the most recent data, the percentage of households deemed fuel poor in  
East Riding was 14.7 per cent, compared to an average in England of 13.2 per cent. In response, we have 
been targeting those on lower incomes for energy efficiency improvements and low-carbon heating grants. 
Costs  - The costs of household energy efficiency and low carbon retrofits remains high. Whilst very 
limited grant funding is available, changes to the market and further Government support will be 
required to reach current targets.
Opportunities
Future Homes and Building Standard - The new standard, setting changes to Building Regulations, 
should ensure that all new homes built from 2025 will produce 75 - 80 per cent less carbon emissions 
compared to current regulations, and produce 31 per cent less from 2022. 
Gas boilers  - The Government’s Net Zero Strategy included the ambition for no new gas boilers to 
be sold by 2035. Although not yet set into law, there has also been indications by Government that as 
part of changes to building regulations there may be a gas boiler ban for new homes as early as 2025. 
Furthermore, in Spring 2022, the Government’s Boiler Upgrade Scheme opened for applications.  
This provides upfront capital grants to support the installation of heat pumps (or biomass boilers in 
some circumstances) in domestic and non-domestic buildings
Health  - Improving the quality of our indoor environment through deep energy retrofits, such 
as improved insulation, can provide benefits to physical health by creating healthy indoor living 
environments with healthy air temperatures, humidity levels, noise levels and improved air quality.
Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund - An application will be made in 2022 to the fund which is for 
social housing landlords to deliver improvements to the fabric of their properties (wall, loft, and other 
insulation measures) to achieve an energy efficiency rating of C or above. This will make the property 
ready for the transfer to low carbon heating such as air source heat pumps in the future.

The commercial and industrial sectors are significant contributors to climate change in the East Riding  
of Yorkshire, accounting for approximately 30 per cent of the areas carbon emissions, as shown in the  
following chart.
Across these two sectors, industry makes up a large proportion of the emissions, reflecting the industrial 
base present in East Riding, particularly in the areas bordering the Humber Estuary.
It is important we work together to drastically reduce commercial and industrial emissions, whilst making 
sure our diverse economy thrives, building on our natural strengths in the food, manufacturing, tourism, 
and renewable energy sectors. 
Growing the green economy will also be vital for powering the transition to net zero, as we look to 
increase capacity and skills in key sectors such as sustainable farming, electric vehicles, domestic retrofit, 
and renewable energy.

48 49Key Challenges and Opportunities
Challenges to Delivery
Carbon intensive business - East Riding is home to many traditional heavy industries that are essential 
to our economy but remain carbon intensive. Working with these to decarbonise is a priority on our 
pathway to net zero. 
Working population  - Compared to the national average, a lower proportion of the population of East 
Riding of Yorkshire is of working age and there are less jobs available for this working age population. 
Whilst these pose different challenges for the local economy, green job creation and attracting high 
skilled workers in the low-carbon and sustainability sector can help overcome these.
Skills deprivation  - There are pockets of skills deprivation in some urban and coastal areas in East 
Riding. Alongside green job creation, working with schools, colleges, and training providers in these areas 
to enhance career opportunities in the green sector will be necessary for creating a greener economy 
and ensuring we reduce rather than exacerbate existing inequalities through climate action.
Understanding climate change  - A survey undertaken by the Carbon Trust in 2020 found many small 
and medium sized companies (SME) were yet to fully appreciate the importance of climate change for 
their business and most thought it would not impact their organisation. This suggested more work is 
needed to communicate the impact of the climate emergency sufficiently to all parts of the economy.
Opportunities
Natural environment  - Our environment in East Riding underpins our local economy through 
agriculture, forestry, fishing, tourism and through an abundance of natural energy resources. This means 
to strengthen and grow our economy we must protect and invest in our natural environment which 
can also have wider health and wellbeing, climate mitigation and adaptation benefits, through carbon 
restoration or flood resilience, for example.
Green jobs  - The share of jobs in the Yorkshire and Humber that are in the green economy is above  
the UK average, indicating a solid foundation for future growth as we look to focus on the production  
of higher-skilled, better paid, and permanent jobs.
Renewable energy  - The Humber has established a merited reputation as the UK’s Energy Estuary,  
with a world-leading renewable energy sector and ambitious industrial decarbonisation targets,  
indicating further growth opportunities for the local energy economy.
Warmer climate  - With East Riding set to experience warmer days we can expect there to be an 
increase in coastal tourism as a result. Maximising the local economic opportunities from the visitor 
economy can help facilitate economic growth, whilst presenting opportunities to enable and encourage 
sustainable and responsible tourism.  
The Aura Innovation Centre
The Aura Innovation Centre (AIC) is a place like no other. Opened in 2020, the AIC accelerates, 
innovates, and collaborates to support business success and drive green innovation. The centre is  
a community that supports businesses of all sizes, helping them to bring their low-carbon projects  
to life.
The AIC, supported by East Riding of Yorkshire Council, connects businesses to the research power 
at the University of Hull, taking an organisation’s carbon reduction objectives and linking them with 
expertise, equipment, and funding to turn their visions into reality. The centre can assist businesses 
with prototyping, testing and the manufacturing of sustainable products, supporting emissions 
reduction and saving of energy costs. 
The AIC has already helped many organisations achieve their sustainable ambitions. Key projects 
already completed include supporting a forestry and horticultural firm to find alternatives to plastic 
tree guards, finding inventive ways to use discarded pea pods, creating energy-efficient lighting for 
vertical farms, and finding ways to commercialise novel nanofibers. Our most recent case studies can 
be viewed on our website: www.aura-innovation.co.uk/case-studies
The Aura Innovation Centre will continue to assist businesses on their journey to net zero, but with 
ERDF funding due to end in June 2023, more support is needed to enable this vital work to continue.
50 51Net Zero Council  
This priority area relates to the activities we are taking as an organisation to tackle climate change 
and build resilience. It includes activities like reducing our carbon footprint, spreading awareness and 
education of climate issues, and embedding climate action across our services. 
In February 2021, East Riding of Yorkshire Council declared a climate emergency and confirmed our 
ambition to be net zero by 2050. This target relates to reducing the emissions that are produced from 
the Council’s own services and operations. Whilst we have set this initial target, our intention is to 
continually review this to reflect our ambition and ability to meet an earlier deadline.
To achieve this will require significant investment in decarbonisation projects and embedding a strong culture 
of climate awareness across the organisation so our staff feel empowered to make change. We also recognise 
our influential role in engaging, educating, and collaborating on climate change across East Riding.
Our established Environmental Policy, Environmental Management System, and Carbon and Energy 
Management Strategy will continue to drive forward positive action to reduce the Council’s carbon footprint.
Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme Funding
East Riding of Yorkshire Council were successful in receiving £1.9 million of funding from phase 1 of the Public 
Sector Decarbonisation Scheme (PSDS) to undertake decarbonisation work across Council sites in 2022. 
The Beverley based Annie-Reed Road Depot will benefit from air source heat pumps to reduce the 
reliance on gas-fired boilers for both heating and hot water.
County Hall will also gain air source heat pumps to transition away from gas fired boilers. It will also 
see the installation of energy efficiency windows, replacement energy efficient hand dryers and the 
installation of flow restrictors to hand wash taps to reduce water consumption.
Bridlington Spa will benefit from air source heat pumps and upgrades to more efficient windows and 
air conditioning units. 
Phase 1 of the PSDS provided £1 billion in grants nationally, reflecting the public sector’s role in 
meeting the Government’s net zero commitment by 2050.

52 53Key Challenges and Opportunities
Challenges to Delivery
Old building stock - We own and manage several old or even historical listed buildings, which tend to 
have a lower energy performance than modern buildings, and for the latter, it limits options for energy 
efficiency improvements.
Energy costs  - Despite reducing our overall energy consumption over time, the total energy costs  
for the Council have actually risen, largely due to the increase in price of grid-supplied electricity. 
Scale of council operations - With an estimated 6,209 corporate employees, 4,955 school-based 
employees, services ranging from libraries to highways maintenance to social care, the scale and 
complexity for reaching net zero as a large unitary authority should not be underestimated.
Homeworking  - The increase in homeworking since the COVID -19 pandemic has reduced emissions 
from staff commuting, but the increase in domestic energy and heating use at our staff homes will  
have to be factored into the Council’s carbon footprint. Calculating and reducing these emissions  
poses a challenge.
Opportunities
Business travel  - There are many potential ways to reduce emissions associated with business travel  
at the authority, including lower emission vehicles, pool car schemes, car sharing and the transition to 
online events.
Schools - Many schools managed by the authority have an energy performance that is below the national 
average, suggesting there are many opportunities for dedicated energy project work with our schools.
Scope 3 emissions - The indirect emissions that occur from our activities are estimated to make up 70 - 
80 per cent of our overall carbon footprint, yet we are only at the starting point for understanding and 
tackling action to reduce these. 
Behaviour change - Changing how we work and live on a daily basis has an important role in reducing 
the further onset of climate change. Moving forward we will explore different interventions to change 
behaviour, potentially including climate literacy training for staff, campaigns on environmentally conscious 
behaviour, and providing supporting mechanisms to encourage change.
Agile transformation  - The Council’s agile project, leading on the transition to becoming a more 
modern, flexible, and responsive workforce brings more opportunities for staff to work digitally or  
from work hubs, potentially closer to their residence. This brings opportunities for reducing  
unnecessary travel. 
CLIMATE 
RESILIENCE
54 55Climate Resilience  
Flooding, coastal erosion and heatwaves can have significant impacts on society, the economy, and 
the natural environment. In the East Riding, this has been demonstrated by the devastating economic 
and human impacts of the June 2007 and December 2013 floods, the complete loss of homes and 
businesses due to ongoing coastal erosion and public health impacts from heatwaves in 2018 and 2019.
Climate change is likely to cause an increase in the frequency and intensity of these weather events,  
so their impacts are likely to also increase significantly. To limit these impacts we must ensure that the East 
Riding is resilient to climate change. While in some cases this may mean negating the impacts of climate 
change (for example through flood and coastal defence schemes), in most cases it will involve adapting our 
buildings, infrastructure and behaviour to reduce the inevitable impacts of future extreme weather events.
The scale of adaptation required will be dependent on the level of future greenhouse gas emissions, 
however the ‘baked in’ impacts of past emissions will require significant action to take place to make the 
East Riding a climate resilient county. 
South Withernsea Coastal Defence Scheme
The challenge of managing the East Riding’s defended and rapidly eroding coastline is anticipated to 
increase as sea level rise driven by climate change and increased storminess impact upon erosion and 
sediment transport rates.
As a response to high erosion rates at the coastline south of Withernsea, in 2019, the Council took 
the decision to construct a new rock armour coastal defence structure that extended the existing 
defences southwards by an additional 400m. The structure was carefully designed to provide 
protection without exacerbating downdrift coastal erosion issues. This scheme was completed in 
2020 at a cost of just over £7 million and has permanently removed approximately 70 residential 
properties from risk, along with 250 chalets and caravans and the A1033 (Hollym Road).
Work has also begun for the creation of additional habitat, through ecological enhancements on the 
completed defence scheme. This will involve the management of the regraded cliff face to create 
maritime cliff and slope habitat, and the potential creation of artificial rockpools, holes and grooves  
in the rock armour itself, which provides habitat for inter-tidal species.
Adapt our buildings, infrastructure and 
behaviours to build resilience in East Riding.
Deliver schemes to manage the risks and 
reduce the impacts of climate change.KEY AREASKey Challenges and Opportunities
Challenges to Delivery
Knowledge  - There is often a lack of understanding and recognition of the impacts of climate change 
beyond flood risk. We need to better understand the wider impacts of climate change in the East Riding 
and the range of potential solutions required and available.
Engagement  - One of the biggest challenges to becoming a more resilient region is engaging with as many communities, 
businesses and stakeholders as possible to promote cultural and behavioural change. This will require large scale and 
prolonged participation across the region, targeting multiple sectors including residents, businesses and educational institutions.
‘Defend-first’ approach  - Much of the national budget for flood and coastal erosion risk management continues to be 
used on defences meaning there is less financial support for adaptation and transition. It has been proved in this area that 
this can be successful and cost effective, particularly in areas where it is not sustainable to install or maintain hard defences. 
No one-size-fits-all solution  - As climate change brings different pressures across areas of the East Riding, 
we recognise that an area-wide single adaptation plan will not be effective.
Older population  - East Riding has a higher proportion of older adults (65+) compared to the England average. Older 
populations are more likely to be vulnerable to extreme heat, poor air quality and extreme events. As an authority we 
aim to ensure homes are suitable for this population across the East Riding, taking into account future climatic change. 
Resilience of energy infrastructure  - Flood events, high-winds and lightning are all examples of weather events that 
have the potential to disrupt energy generation, transmission and distribution. Planning for and monitoring these 
risks is essential to ensure our energy infrastructure can be climate resilient, so we can avoid future losses of power. 
Opportunities
Coastal adaptation and transition  - The Council has recently secured funding to deliver an East Riding Coastal 
Transition Accelerator Programme, in partnership with the Environment Agency. The programme aims to deliver 
effective coastal change management, transitioning away from a reactive approach (prioritising those at imminent 
risk) to a planned long-term transition based on the projected impacts of climate driven coastal change.
Co-benefits  - The designing of areas to be more resilient to flooding and heatwaves often results in multiple benefits such as 
better access to green space, improved air quality and health benefits. This is especially the case where multiple uses of space is 
factored into the design of open spaces. For instance, a flood storage area which acts as sports pitches in the summer.
Education  - Working with the Hull and East Riding Living with Water partnership, our flood risk strategy 
team have visited schools to engage with young people on the water cycle, flood risk and water management, 
increasing awareness of the impacts of climate change and to learn more about their role in reducing flood risk.
Local Resilience Forums  - The Government has committed to strengthening the role of Local Resilience Forums so they are 
able to support delivery of more climate resilience initiatives and further minimise the impacts of potential emergency events.
Mental health  - The threat from flooding and coastal change have been shown to cause significant 
physical and mental health issues. Any actions which can be taken to make communities more resilient  
to flooding and coastal change will have benefits for health and wellbeing.
56 57How can you reduce your carbon footprint?
For shorter trips, walking and cycling is a good way to reduce your carbon footprint and can have a 
positive impact on your health.
If you cannot access more sustainable forms of travel, have you considered car sharing? It is a great 
way to help the environment and can save you money on travel costs too. Liftshare manages a car 
sharing scheme that is open to all. See link liftshare.com/uk
Switching to a green energy tariff can reduce your carbon footprint.
Installing renewable energy technologies (e.g. solar panels) on a property can significantly  
reduce the carbon footprint of your home and save you money.
Replacing lights with LED bulbs, washing your clothes less frequently and not leaving your devices 
on standby can help you save energy and money.
Line drying clothes where possible promotes energy saving.
Consider how a product is packaged. Can you reuse or recycle these materials? 
Avoid single-use plastics where possible and use reusable shopping bags and cups.
Use your brown kitchen caddies to store food waste at your home before transferring it to your 
brown wheelie bin.
Have you considered donating old clothes, rather than throwing them away?
Do you have any unwanted domestic large appliances still in good working order? You can donate 
these at your local recycling site. www.eastriding.gov.uk/environment/bins-rubbish-recycling/  
tips-and-recycling-sites/recycling-site-finder
If you are interested in planting trees on your land or volunteering to help plant trees, check out 
this link to get involved with the Humber Forest www.humberforest.org/get-involved
As weather patterns shift due to climate change, some insects that depend on particular flowers 
might suffer, so consider planting a diverse variety of pollinator friendly plants with ranging 
flowering times. Planting trees and plants can help tackle climate change by absorbing carbon 
dioxide and reduce risks of flooding by slowing rainwater runoff. 
Consider shopping locally for your food and drink.Have you considered the energy performance of your home or business? You may be able to  
find the energy certificate for your property, along with tips for improving its efficiency,  
here www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate
See the Council website for advice and support on improving energy efficiency at home.  
www.eastriding.gov.uk/housing/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-at-home
Consider shopping local. Locally owned businesses often make more local purchases requiring less 
transportation and cutting carbon emissions.
If planning a holiday, have you considered local or domestic destinations? Staying local can reduce 
your carbon footprint. See websites below for more information.  
www.visithullandeastyorkshire.co.uk  www.visitbritain.com/gb/en
When installing renewable energy or heat pumps, source a reputable local trader to help build 
local supply chains. See the website for more information - mcscertified.com/find-an-installer
You can sign up to receive personal flood alerts or warnings by phone, text or email here:  
www.gov.uk/sign-up-for-flood-warnings
In hot temperatures, trees can offer effective ways of keeping cool. If possible, consider planting 
trees in your garden as they can provide shade for you and your home.
Exterior shutters or blinds can reduce overheat exposure in homes.
Refrain from opening windows when the outside temperature is higher than indoors.

58 59Governance 
This strategy is a living document, which means that as our knowledge of climate change improves,  
or more national policy and legislation come into effect, this will be reflected within the strategy.  
We will review the strategy annually to ensure it is up to date and accurate. We will also provide an 
annual update on progress through a revised Environmental Statement. This will reflect key activity  
taken throughout the year and achievements made, including reporting our corporate and areawide 
carbon footprints. 
Taking action to address the Climate Emergency cannot be done solely by officers, but instead needs  
a multi-disciplinary approach. We will need to draw on skills and resources from across the organisation 
and with wider partners. It will need to be part of the way we do things and embedded in the way we 
deliver our services. We will review our service plans to ensure that they align with the ambition of  
the strategy.
We will also explore the opportunities to develop an areawide climate change action group. This could 
take several forms and will be subject to public consultation to ensure it meets the needs of residents. 
Such a group would aim to expand on existing community involved and support future action. It would 
enable regular two-way dialogue and share ideas with and across local community representatives. 
Due to the broad range of areas the Climate Change Strategy covers it is essential to have an action plan 
detailing activities and projects that contribute to the strategy vision and priorities. The action plan for 
this strategy is in development and will cover each of the priority areas identified. The action plan will  
be updated every five years, except for the initial action plan, which will be for the period 2022 - 2025. 
The initial period of the action plan will lay the foundations for future activity and focus in on actions that 
will deliver rapid emission reductions. 
Climate action will also be monitored through our corporate risk register, which as well as quarterly 
reporting will be reviewed annually to ensure that we are capturing all the risks effectively and that they 
are still appropriate. Action will also be scrutinised at regular meetings of Environment and Regeneration 
Overview and Scrutiny.
Targets 
The council set a target for its services to be net zero by 2050 in line with national government.  
This target will be reviewed over the period of the next action plan to ensure we are able to achieve  
it and identify opportunities to bring this date forward if possible.
An areawide emissions target has not currently been set. This is because such a target needs to be 
developed through extensive consultation across partner organisations, businesses, and residents.  
During the course of the action plan, we will consult widely on a potential areawide target which  
can be supported and monitored by the action group as defined within the governance section.Road Map to Net Zero

Understanding Climate Change Language 
Term Definition
Carbon footprintA carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases that are generated by the actions of a 
particular individual, organisation, or community. The UK average footprint for 2022 is 9.5 tonnes 
per person. It includes activities relating to commuting, food, shopping, and travel. 
Circular economyA circular economy is a model of making and using products, which involves sharing, reusing, 
refurbishing, and recycling existing materials and products, so that they can be used for as long 
as possible. It is a solution to the global climate emergency where products and services are 
designed to maximise their value and use and minimise waste. It can be explained as ‘make, 
use, remake’. 
Climate changeClimate change is the long-term changes in global temperatures and other characteristics of 
the earth’s atmosphere. The earth is surrounded by a layer of greenhouse gases, which 
trap heat from the sun, keeping our planet warm. Since the industrial revolution and the 
burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas, more greenhouse gases have been released into the 
atmosphere, which traps more of the sun’s heat causing the planet to heat up. Climate change 
affects everyone and as the earth warms, we will experience more unpredictable and extreme 
weather events such as big storms and heavy rainfall to droughts and wildfire. 
Climate resilienceClimate resilience is the ability to anticipate, prepare for and respond to hazardous events, 
trends or disturbances related to climate.
Climate riskClimate risk refers to the potentially negative impacts of climate change, for example the potential 
adverse effects on lives, the economy, and the environment.
Decarbonisation Decarbonisation refers to the process of removing carbon dioxide from a given activity.  
For example, the decarbonisation of the national grid means the reduction of the amount of 
carbon used to generate a unit of electricity. 
Energy efficiencyEnergy efficiency means using less energy to get the same job done and eliminating waste energy. 
For example, energy-efficient LED lightbulbs can produce the same amount of light as 
normal lightbulbs but use 75 - 80 per cent less electricity. 
Fairer and more 
equitable society 
/ equalitiesThe principles of equity, justice and fairness are fundamental to understanding and addressing the 
challenges of global climate change. An equitable society is one in which everyone can participate 
and prosper and is fair and reasonable in a way that gives equal treatment to everyone. 
Fuel povertyIn England, a household is considered fuel poor if they are living in a property with an energy 
efficiency rating of band D or below, and when they spend the required amount to heat their 
home, they are left with a residual income below the official poverty line.
Green economyA green economy is a concept that creates a sustainable low-emission world that benefits  
both society and the planet. A green economy is defined as low carbon, resource efficient 
and socially inclusive and is driven by investments into activities, infrastructure and assets that 
benefit the planet.Term Definition
Land Use, Land 
Use Change 
and Forestry 
(LULUCF)The LULUCF sector covers emissions and removals of greenhouse gases resulting from direct 
human-induced land use, land-use change and forestry activities. Carbon is sequestered by 
forestry and grassland, while carbon losses occur on existing cropland and natural land  
(e.g. grassland) that is converted to cropland or settlement.
Net zero and 
carbon neutralBeing Carbon Neutral means balancing greenhouse gas emissions by ‘offsetting’ (removing from 
the atmosphere) an equivalent amount of carbon for the amount produced. A commitment 
to being carbon neutral does not require or imply a commitment to reduce overall GHG 
emissions. In contrast, a commitment to net zero means reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
with the goal of balancing emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere. 
For the purposes of this strategy, we will use the following definition (SBTi Net Zero Standard 
2021): Reducing scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions to zero or to a residual level that is consistent with 
reaching net zero emissions at the global or sector level in eligible 1.5°C-aligned pathways 
Neutralizing any residual emissions at the net zero target year and any GHG emissions 
released into the atmosphere thereafter.
Scope 1,2 and 3 
emissionsGreenhouse gas emissions are divided into three different groups or scopes to help trace 
where those emissions came from and make it easier to report on them. Scope 1 emissions are 
produced directly at source from fuel combustion e.g. for company vehicles. Scope 2 emissions 
are indirect emissions from purchased electricity. Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions  
e.g. from outsourced services or purchased goods. 
SustainabilitySustainability means meeting our own needs without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs. Sustainability does not only refer to environmentalism, 
but also includes things such as social equity and economic development. Sustainability as a 
value is shared by many individuals and organisations who want to demonstrate it through their 
policies, everyday activities, and behaviours. 
Sustainable 
transportSustainable transport refers to any type of transport that has a low impact on the environment 
and is also about balancing our current and future needs. Examples of sustainable transport 
include walking, cycling, car sharing or ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEV) e.g. electric vehicles. 
Vulnerability in 
the context of 
climate changeClimate change vulnerability is the tendency to be adversely affected by climate change and 
is a component of climate risk. It refers to the degree to which places / people / the natural 
environment are susceptible to and unable to cope with the adverse effects of climate change, 
for example extreme weather variability and extremes.
