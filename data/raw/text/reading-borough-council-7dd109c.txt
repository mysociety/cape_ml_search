Classification: OFFICIAL  1. Introduction  
The use of energy, water and other natural resources is essential to the operation 
of Reading Borough Council and in providing services to the community. Whilst 
vital to the functioning of the organisation, it is crucial that our use of energy and 
water is  managed and minimised to reduce our impact on the environment, limit 
our expenditure and mitigate our exposure to insecure energy supplies and limited 
water resources.  
The use of certain types of energy directly, or indirectly, produces greenhouse gas 
emissions, typically in the form of carbon dioxide, such as from the combustion of 
natural gas in boilers, or from combustion of gas in power stations generating 
electricity for the National Grid. Greenhouse gases are a main factor is causing 
man-made climate change, which is having , and will in the future have , a 
significant impact on our way of life and the world around us. By limiting our 
energy and water use and thereby restricting our carbon emissions we are helping 
to safeguard our world for future gener ations. The urgency and importance of 
doing so was underlined by the Council’s declaration of a climate emergency in 
February 2019, committing to the ambitious goal of a net zero carbon Reading by 
2030.  
The Council’s Carbon Plan sets out our policy and tar gets on corporate energy and 
water management, and identifies actions to achieve these within the time period 
2020- 2025. The plan includes actions to ensure the authority is compliant with 
relevant legislation (such as Energy Performance in Buildings legis lation) and 
national reporting requirements ( such as Green house Gas Protocol s). The Plan will 
assist the council in making energy and water management an integral part of its 
decision -making  processes, to ensure efficient use of these resources today and in 
the future.  
Crucially, the implementation of the Plan will:  
• Contribute to the Corporate Plan aim to ‘Build a Council fit for the future’ 
by improving the efficiency of our operations and minimising costs  
• Deliver many of the Council’s commitments as set out in the Reading 
Climate Emergency Strategy 2020 -25 
• Enable the Council to lead by example as we encourage Reading businesses, 
organisations and residents to reduce their own environmental impacts.  
An assessment of ‘value at stake’ show ed that b y basing our  carbon reduction  
investments on robust business cases, the council has avoided energy costs of 
around £11 million since 2008/09, including some £1.5m in 2018/19 alone.  
Looking ahead, the estimated ‘value at stake’  by 2025/26 is £1.5m  for buildings 
alone  – this is summarised in figure 1.1 below .

2. Our Vision and Ambition  
In February 2019, Reading Borough Council declared a Climate Emergency and set 
out on a journey to achieve a carbon neutral borough by 2030.   
A key element of this vision was the that the Council would lead by example to 
bring about the changes needed. It  is therefore important that the Council shows 
that it can make meaningful progress towards being zero carbon in its operations 
by 2025.  Our vision for the Council in this Carbon Plan is therefore to :  
‘lead by example and work in partnership towards achieving net zero 
carbon operations  by 2030’ . 
Setting ambitious yet realistic targets for carbon reduction and renewable energy 
generation by 2025 will be important to  keep us on track to the ultimate goal of  
becoming a  net zero organisation by 2030.  
The Carbon Plan 2020- 25 will work towards four  headline targets as follows - by 
2025 we will:  
• Reduce the organisation’s carbon emissions by 85%, against a 2008/9 
baseline1  
• Generate equivalent to 50% of our energy from renewable sources by 20252 
• Reduce our use of fossil fuels by 5 0%, against a 2008/09 baseline3 
• Achieve a 5% p.a. reduction  in water use  against a 2019/20 baseline.  
By achieving these targets Reading Borough Council will be on track to meet its 
challenging ambition of becoming a net zero carbon organisation by 2030.  
  
                                                           
1 By 2018/19 RBC had achieved a 63% reduction in carbon emissions against a 2008/09 baseline –  to reach 85% 
by 2025 will involve almost halving our current energy use  
 
2 By 2018- 19 RBC was generating c.10% of its energy needs from renewable sources so while a 50% target is 
ambitious this will be 50% of a much smaller total energy demand in light of the demand reduction measures 
set out within the Plan  
 
3 A Policy Committ ee resolution [ reference]  requires inclusion of a fossil fuel reduction target in this Carbon 
Plan - the ability to achieve the proposed fossil fuel reduction target of 50% is, however,  heavily dependent on 
switching the Refuse Collection Vehicle Fleet to EV, which is currently the subject of ongoing feasibility study. 
In the event that a switch to EV proves impossible during the period of this plan (e.g.  for technical reasons), it 
is unlikely that this target will be met. While this would also make the ach ievement of the headline 85% carbon 
reduction in the Plan target more challenging, it would remain within reach assuming that the shortfall could 
be made up from other areas of our corporate carbon footprint.

Classification: OFFICIAL  3. Managing our resources –  progress to date  
Since Reading Borough Council signed the Nottingham Declaration on Climate 
Change in 2006 the authority has undertaken a wide range of work to address 
energy, water and carbon management, focusing on reducing costs, limiting its 
impact on the environment, decarbonising our energy supply and integrating these 
approaches across the organisation. In the last five years, the organisation has 
been working on the actions set out in the Carbon Plan 2015 -20 to achieve a 
carbon emission reduction target of 50% by 2020, against the 2008/9 baseline.  
Reading has a strong track record on carbon emission s reduction, being amongst 
the top ten boroughs in the Country for reductions since 2005, totalling 228kT CO 2 
or 52% of Reading ’s total reductions.  In the latest year for which data is available 
(2018/19), Reading was 4th out of all the English local authorities by this metric.  
During the same period Read ing Borough Council has reduced its own emissions 
faster than the borough with reductions of 63% in the decade from 2008 to 2018, 
achieving the 50% reduction target in the Carbon Plan 2015 -20 three years early . 
Reading Borough Council’s current corporate e nergy use is principally through 
electricity and gas, for buildings and street lighting, with a small volume of fuel oil 
for heating buildings, with the cost in 2018/19 totalling over  £1.8m .  
Figure 3.1: Breakdown of Reading Borough Council carbon footprint, 2018/19  
The carbon emissions from energy used in buildings accounted for 68% of the 
Council’s carbon footprint in 2018/19, as shown  in Figure 3. 1 above . Carbon 
emissions from street lighting have reduced as a proportion of the total since 
2008/09 . Other energy is used to fuel cars for the RBC fleet and business travel,

Classification: OFFICIAL  which now account s for a higher proportion of the carbon footprint  as emissions 
from other sectors have been reduced -  up from 10% in 2008/9 to 18% in 2018/19.  
Unit prices for ene rgy have gradually increased over the last six years, so although 
energy use in kWh has decreased by nearly 50% since 2008/9, spend on energy has 
remained relatively stable.  
Carbon emissions reductio n over the last 10 years has  mainly been achieved 
throug h reductions across the building and street lighting estate. Reduction in 
building energy use has accounted for nearly three quarters of the total emissions 
reduction, whilst street lighting changes are credited with 20% of the total 
emissions savings, as illustrated in Figures 3.2 & 3. 3 below.

Classification: OFFICIAL  Areas where the most significant progress in reducing emissions has been made, 
and a summary of how these have been achieved, are summarised below:  
Street lighting  
The entire street lighting estate, totalling over 13,000 units, across Reading 
Borough has been upgraded to LED, resulting in over 50% reduction in electricity 
consumption, and the ability to have greater remote control of the lighting.  
Buildings 
The carbo n reductions within buildings can be attributed to numerous projects. 
The Building Rationalisation strategy followed over the last 7 years, resulting in 
the disposal of assets, relocation and co -location of services into buildings with a 
higher intensity o f use, has reduced the overall demand for energy across the 
organisation. The key buildings to account for this include the (old) Civic Offices, 
Central Pool, Arthur Hills Baths and smaller libraries and community centres.  
Building refurbishment has been k ey in the Building Rationalisation programme, 
where services are brought together in a new hub. Significant investment in energy 
efficiency measures, principally through Salix funding, has been made in a ‘whole 
building’ approach to the refurbishment of the Civic Offices, Reading Town Hall, 
and 19 Bennet Road depot building. Energy saving measures include insulation, LED 
lighting and controls, heating upgrades, electrification of heat and solar pv.  
Additional Salix funds have been invested in smaller build ing projects across the 
council estate, totalling  101 pr ojects, and £1.4m investment . 
Renewable energy  
To date the Council has installed over 7,500 solar panels on 40+ council, 
community and school buildings, and 457 houses. In 201 8/19 the systems 
generate d 1.6 MWh of electricity, the equivalent to powering over 400 houses with 
100% of their electricity needs. The Civic Offices now hosts the Council’s largest 
solar panel system with 572 solar panels, generating an estimated 10% of the 
building’s electricity . Most recently, a roof mounted solar P.V.  system was 
installed at 19 Bennet Road. This represents the first phase of renewable onsite 
generation at the depot.  
Travel & transport  
Within the last 5 years, the Council has invested in nine electric vehicles w ith 
associated charging points. Investigations are ongoing to establish the best route 
for full electrification of the vehicle fleet.

Classification: OFFICIAL  4. The Council’s route to net zero c arbon  
In pursuing a successful carbon reduction strategy to date, t he Council has focused 
on schemes offering the best return on investment. W hile this will continue, it is 
inevitable that additional carbon reductions and the associated returns will be 
more challenging  to achieve as we approach net zero  – the ‘low -hanging fruit’ has 
been harvested requiring us to reach higher for future reductions.  
To guide us we ha ve structured this Carbon Plan around t he actions set out by the 
Committee for Climate Change  in its July 2019 report ‘Reducing UK emissions : 
Progress Report to Parliament’ . This identifie s four key themes over the next five 
years to drive further and deep er carbon emissions reductions, and by adopting 
these we can position the organisation to achieve net zero carbon by 2030 through 
innovation in demand side management, renewable generation and energy storage 
solutions.  
Policy statement  
Reading Borough Council is committed to working to reduce its energy use, 
Greenhouse Gas emissions and water use across its estate and operations, and to 
make energy, carbon an d water savings an integral part of the everyday decision -
making process. Reading Borough Council is dedicated to substantially reduce its 
dependence on fossil fuels to reach net zero carbon by 2030 and diversify its range 
of energy supplies, thereby reduc ing the organisation’s exposure to the volatility 
of the energy markets, limited water resource availability and the financial risks 
from price fluctuations. We are committed to invest in the generation of 
renewable energy, to supply energy to both our cou ncil operations and our 
surrounding community. We will ensure that the necessary systems and processes 
are in place to allow continuous improvement in the council’s operations, through 
effective monitoring and management of energy and water use.  
Targets  
We will reduce RBC’s carbon footprint by 85 % by 2025, and aim for 100 % by 2030, 
against a 2008/9 baseline, to include provision of sufficient renewable energy to 
meet net zero carbon emissions by 2030.  
To meet these 2025 targets, on an annual basis we will need to  reduce RBC’s 
energy use by an average of 4.4 % per year , and double our renewable energy 
generation every t wo years such that we are generating 50% of our energy from 
renewable sources by 2025.   
We will also  adopt  a fossil fuel target to reduce our diesel and petrol consumption 
by 50% by 2025.   
In addition , we will seek to reduce our water consumption by 5 % per annum 
against a 201 9/20 baseline.  Classification: OFFICIAL

Classification: OFFICIAL  Measuring progress  
The Council measures its emissions using the internationally accepted annual 
reporting process known as the Green House Gas (GHG) emissions reporting 
protocol. This is carried out in respect of the emissions for which we have control 
(known as Scope 1&2), but also for managed services, emissions from which are 
not in our direct control  (known as Scope 3). We also monitor the emissions of 
community schools. The Council will continue to monitor and manage its carbon 
emissions through the GHG reporting protoco l. 
We will review progress against our aims and targets annually, review ing the Policy 
& Strategy after 3 years and develop ing a new strategy for the 2025 -2030 period  as 
we approach this phase of our journey towards net zero carbon . 
Pathway towards net z ero carbon – our four key a ims 
Led by the priorities set out by the national Committee on Climate Change, t his 
Carbon Plan is structured around the  following four aims : 
i) REDUC E - we will reduce our energy demand through energy efficiency 
measures, asset dis posal  and other measures to reduce demand  
 
ii) DECARBONISE – we will reduce emissions from ongoing activities via 
electrification  of heat ing and vehicle fleets  
 
iii) GENERATE – we will install further renewable energy capacity to meet a 
higher proportion of our own needs  
 
iv) SMART – we will align consumption with generation, adopting new 
technologies to help balance changing patterns of supply and demand

4.1 REDUCE  
 
4.1.1  The pathway to reduce  energy demand  
The first stage of an  energy management and carbon reduction strategy is  to 
reduce demand for energy and to make the use of energy as  efficient as possible. 
The biggest reductions to date have been following these principles. Further 
focussed action needs to happen across the Council’s building, street lighting and 
vehicle estate.   
Ensuring that we keep our  building, street lighting and vehicles estate under 
constant review, a nd rationalis ing it to ensure that we retain only those  assets 
needed for the operation  of services, will help limit our energy demand . Energy 
efficiency technologies can  then be installed  in retained assets; including, for 
example, LED  lighting and controls, insulation, heating controls, improved glazing, 
reduced solar gain and ‘ A’-rated electrical equipment.  
All full building refurbishments and new builds need to be to a high standard  of 
energy efficiency , to ensure long term energy inefficiencies are not engrained 
from the outset and to avoid the cost of any future retrofit. More efficient 
technologies are always being produced and where possible we will make 
investments to ensure that we operate the most energy efficient equipment and 
plant whilst ensuring that we procure at the right times to avoid unsustainable 
waste. Additional ly, cross- organisation awareness -raising  and training will help to 
make the use of buildings and equipment as  efficient  as possible.  
The following section summarises  the principal actions which the council will take 
to ‘Reduce’ carbon emissions by  2,987 tCO2, or 15. 1% against the 2008/09 
baseline. Figure s 4.1 and 4.2 below illustrates these savings graphically . 
• Rationalisation  of building estate: based on the known or likely building 
disposals, carbon emissions savings  are predicted to be 878 tCO 2, or a further 
4.4 % against the  2008/09 baseline. There are significant additional 
opportunities to make savings within this area , ensuring that the organisation is 
maximising the use of the most efficient facilities  and disposing of inefficient 
assets.  Energy efficiency needs to be a central consideration for development 
of our  asset st rategy.   
• Dimming & trimming , and inventory update of street lighting: by updating and 
correcting the street lighting inventory,  upgrading remaining assets,  along with 
instituting a ‘ dimming and trimming’  regime across specific areas in Reading, it 
is esti mated that 459 tCO 2 can be saved,  or 2.3 % against the 2008/09 baseline.   
• Building light ing: within  the retained estate,  building energy use needs to be 
addressed. LED technology has developed significantly since the Council first 
installed it over 10 years ago. All buildings should have the lighting upgraded, 
and controls installed where appropriate. Typical energy savings  from LED 
lighting range from 40 -80%, which in combination with reduced maintenance Classification: OFFICIAL

Classification: OFFICIAL  costs and longer lamp life can bring significant saving s. By upgrading the 
remaining lighting across all buildings by 2025, it is estimated that 249 tCO 2 
saving will be mad e, or a further 1.3% against the 2008/09 baseline . 
• Building small power improvements: e lectrical equipment , such as monitors, 
printers, fridges and phone chargers,  within buildings  when at end of life should 
be upgraded to the most energy efficient version s possible. Energy ratings 
should be a central point of consideration when electrical equipment is being 
procured. By making these improvements across the entire building estate, it is 
estimated 115 tCO 2, or 0.6% savings are made by 2025.  
• Heating demand reduction through building envelope improvements  and 
building cooling and heating improvements : ageing buildings built and/or 
refurbished when standards were lower than today  tend to have high heat loss 
and therefore higher demand for heat than necessary. By improving the 
building envelope , heat losse s and gains can be significantly reduced  thereby 
reducing the energy needed  for heating or  cooling. This can be achieved b y 
installing building insulation, improving glazing, insulating pipework and 
draught sealing buildings. In combination with upgrades to heating and cooling 
systems and their associated controls, reductions to the carbon footprint will 
total 526 tCO 2, or a furthe r 2.7% against the 2008/09 baseline.  
• Awareness raising : ensuring every member of staff is aware of the need for 
efficient use of energy, and understands the  actions they can take as an 
individual to reduce their consumption, is predicted to result in 267tCO 2, or a 
further 1.4% sa vings against the 2008/09 baseline . 
• Rationalisation and downsizing of fleet : a recent Green Fleet Review  (GFR)  in 
2020 analysed the composition and usage of the organisation’s vehicle fleet. 
Based on the size and mileage, the review has recommended that consideration 
should be given to downsizing the fleet, in particular in the Heavy Commercial 
Vehicle (HCV) sector . HCVs have high fuel consumption per mile, so should be 
limited to work which specifically requires such vehicles. The GFR recommends 
that replacement of HCV with smaller vehicles should be done in combination 
with electrification. If any HCVs can be down sized  and electrified, it is 
estimated  393 tCO 2 can be saved, or 2 % against the 2008/09 baseline , as 
illustrated in Figure 4.3 below . 
• Efficient driving training : driver training to encourage safe and fuel -efficient 
driving is estimated to help contribute to 100.5 tCO 2, or 0.5 % of saving, as set 
out in the GFR (2020) , and illustrated in Figure 4.3 below . Classification: OFFICIAL

4.2.1  The pathway to electrification  
Buildings  
In addition to reducing our energy demand as far as possible, to meet our targets 
we also need to reduce direct fossil fuel consumption such as our gas and vehicle 
fuel consumption. This means that we nee d to change how we heat buildings and 
how we fuel or power vehicles.  
Gas boilers are the most prevalent means of heating buildings and up until 
recently, provided among the lowest carbon intensity heating technology for 
delivering space heating in the winter. The reason for this was that electricity 
generated remotely in power stations was traditionally produced using fossil fuels, 
and in particular carbon intensive coal fired power stations. This process of 
generating electricity is only about 30% effi cient with much of the energy from 
burning the fossil fuels being lost as heat through the generation process , typically 
visible in  the clouds of steam emitted from cooling towers at power stations. 
Electricity consumed in buildings in 2010 therefore had a  67% higher carbon  
footprint than the combustion process itself (2010 carbon intensity figures: 
540gCO 2 for electricity compared to gas at 180gCO 2). Gas boilers on the other hand 
directly combust the gas supplied to the site via the gas network  and are typ ically 
85-90% efficient.   
As electricity generation has shifted away from coal to gas and now renewable 
sources such as biomass, wind and solar, the carbon intensity of electricity from 
the National Grid has decreased significantly. With  more renewable sou rces coming 
online, the carbon intensity of electricity is predicted to half by 2030, whilst 
natural gas carbon intensity is due to rise, as illustrated in Figure 4. 4 below.

Classification: OFFICIAL  The government, in line with  the recent Committee on Climate Change report 
‘Reducing UK emissions Progress Report to Parliament’  (2019), now advocate a 
move away from gas heating and towards heating by electrical means. Heat pump s 
are seen as the best technology to fill this gap, as they efficiently use the 
renewable heat from the natural environment (ground, air or water) for space and 
water h eating. Electricity is used by the heat pump to transfer and compress heat 
from the natural resource and transfer it to where it is needed. Heat pumps are 
considered highly efficient, when designed and sized appropriately, as they can be 
300-500% efficient  (3-5 units of energy are produced for every 1 unit of energy put 
in), compared to a 90% efficient boiler.  
To meet the net zero target, the authority must therefore  shift its heating from 
fossil fuel to electrical, and principally heat pumps. This technolo gy does  prove a 
challenge for retrofitting given that existing heating systems are designed and 
sized for a very different heat generation technology (gas boilers). It is therefore 
essential that building heat losses are reduced to a minimum and that the h eat 
delivery system is designed appropriately. Electrical capacity of the building and 
local infrastructure needs to be considered. The organisation needs to ensure that 
there is sufficient capacity and capability  within the m echanical and electrical 
engin eering professions to manage this transition . 
To deploy this technology across the authority, it is proposed that it is introduced 
in phases, with a small number of  key buildings in the first few years, and installed 
across a significant proportion of the estate by 2025 , as illustrated in Figure 4. 5 
below.

Classification: OFFICIAL  Electric vehicles  
Electric vehicle technology has advanced rapidly in recent years. With no tailpipe 
emissions, their carbon emissions are indirect and are associated with the fuel 
used to generate the electricity for the powering and manufacture of the vehicles. 
Electric v ehicles are significantly more energy efficient than internal combustion 
engine (ICE) vehicles and the Green Fleet Review (2020) has estimated that the 
energy use of an all -electric fleet would be at least 75% less than the equivalent 
ICE fleet.    
The Green Fleet Review (2020), on the basis of t hese more efficient vehicles, in 
combination with falling carbon intensity  of the grid , demonstrat es that a phased 
electrification of the fleet would bring significant contributions to meeting the net 
zero carbon targets.  It is estimated that an all- electric fleet would reduce energy 
use (kWh) by 75%, and carbon emissions by 90% , as illustrated by Table 4. 1 below 
(GFR 2020) . Furthermore, if solar electricity generation is co -located with the 
electric vehicle charge points, there would be the opportunity to achieve net zero 
by 2030.

2020 prices.  Green Fleet Review 2020

We are already approaching the point where Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)  up to 
3.5 tonnes should be less expensive to buy and run than their ICE equivalent 
because they will not need expensive emission control and “light -weighting” 
technology to meet challenging new air quality emission regulations. Over the next 
5 years  the c ost of batteries will continue to fall and their energy density (kWh per 
kg) will increase. Affordable battery electric cars and vans with a single- charge 
range of 300 miles or more will become the norm.   
BEVs have many fewer moving parts  (under 80 moving parts in the drive train of a 
BEV and over 2,000 in a typical ICE vehicl e, giving much lower  service costs 
(experience to date in car and van fleets suggests 30% to 40% lower but some 
operators suggest 60% to 80% lower for some vehicle categories) and higher 
reliability.  BEVs already have lower energy (fuel) costs; a typical electric car or 
small van, charged overnight on a standard tariff, costs no more than £0.04/mile 
or about one third the comparable ICE cost. Using off -peak tariffs BEV energy co sts 
can be as low as £0.02/mile and private users on some tariffs (e.g. Octopus Agile) 
can occasionally be paid to charge their cars.  Classification: OFFICIAL

Classification: OFFICIAL  With the Refuse Collection Vehicles (RCV) fleet, consisting of 13 vehicles, making 
up over 37% of the organisation’s trans port carbon emissions, action in this sector 
of the fleet  is a high priority . The Green Fleet Review has run initial analysis  on 
electrifying the RCV fleet, with results showing that that the reduction in carbon 
emissions from using eRCVs is substantial ev en when charged from the UK grid. In 
the first phase of change over it should be at least 70% but by 2029/30 the 
decarbonisation of the UK grid is expected to have increased the annual reduction 
in GHG emissions to at least 90%.  
Further detailed analysis o f the fleet and the financial implications of the 
electrification of the fleet is needed, but initial results indicate that there would 
be a strong business case for the organisation to  have an all- electric fleet by 2030  – 
and this may in any case be driven by national policy which is rumoured to be 
bringing forward the ban on sales of new petrol/diesel vehicles to 2030 . The move 
to electric vehicles has significant implications for the electrical charging 
infrastructure at depots, offices and at employees’  homes where vans may be 
parked overnight , and this needs to be considered when planning the fleet change 
over.

4.3 GENERATE 
 
4.3.1  The pathway to renewable energy generation  
Clean low carbon energy supply must be at the heart of a zero carbon Council  
strategy . The Council has installed around 7500 solar panels across its building estate 
to date, including social housing , and  Reading’s Civic Offices , which has  the largest 
multi solar array system in Reading, with seven arrays mounted on the roof and a 
total of >5 00 solar panels. However,  in order to supply the equivalent amount of 
energy to the electricity being used  by the organisation, it must not only cover the 
electricity we use to power lighting and buildings , but also the energy needed for 
newly electrified heat and vehicle use, which currently is  predominantly fuelled by  
fossil fuels such as gas , petrol and diesel.  
This section  is primarily concerned with the plan to increase the provision of 
renewable electricity. Whilst a key aspect of the renewable energy  available locally 
is the heat stored in the ground, rivers and aquifers, this is dealt with in the 
decarbonisation section as electricity is used to run the heat pumps  which rely on 
these sources. However, u nless this electricity is from a renewable source this is not 
‘pure’ renewable energy.  
Since the Feed in Tariff subsidy was introduced in 2010 , the cost of solar panel  
installations has reduced to around a quarter of their original price. Whilst the 
subsidy has been discontinued for new connections , solar panels are now cost 
effective without it.   
In current financial modelling, solar pv systems need to be sized so that the majority 
of the renewably generated electricity is supplied to and used onsite, rather than 
being exported to the National Grid. In practice this means that solar pv system sizes 
are limited in capacity size to just above the electrical baseload of the building  on 
which they are sited . When taking this into consideration with the seasonality of 
generation  (the majority of electricity generated from solar pv systems occur ring in 
the summer months ), a problem exists in the sense that  there is space available for 
systems which generate ‘too much’ electricity for use at a given  site, yet this 
renewable ele ctricity generation is essential for reducing the carbon emissions of 
the organisation and the borough. To resolve this issue, we need to work out how to 
shift excess electricity generation to times when it is needed  such as winter 
evenings, when lighting and heat demands peak, yet solar electricity generation is 
very low or zero. There is the potential for this problem to be resolved with onsite 
battery storage.  
Wind energy in the national network has increased dramatically due to offshore wind 
development  and it is expected that there will be periods when very low carbon 
energy is available from the grid.  Reading is not generally considered to be a good 
location for wind generation and indeed the wind turbine at Green Park is not 
considered to be a high ‘y ield’ turbine. That said , wind remains a good resource in Classification: OFFICIAL   
Appendix 3: DRAFT RBC CORPORATE CARBON PLAN 2020 -25 
22 | Page  
 
Classification: OFFICIAL  the UK and the turbine is profitable , providing  the largest single contribution of 
clean renewably generated energy in Reading.  
Local community energy organisations in recent years have installed r enewable 
energy assets across the county . Reading Community Energy Society (RCES) has been 
active within Reading, installing numerous solar pv systems across the borough. 
Whilst Reading Borough Council does not directly own the renewable energy assets 
installed by RCES , we have been involved in establishing and supporting the 
development of RCES and Reading Hydro. Currently the Council owns shares in both 
and this remains a mutually beneficial way of investing in renewable energy locally.  
Shares in community energy cost a very similar amount in terms of investment per 
tonne of carbon but offer wider benefits to the community .  
Carbon  dioxide  emissions  are defined  by the Greenhouse  Gas protocol  which  defines  
the emissions  as direct  and indirect.   A host of offsetting  products  and ‘green  power’  
options  are available  on the market  and these  are varied  in their approach. For the 
latter,  the Council  procures  100% 'green'  electric ity through Renewable  Energy  
Guarantees  of Origin  (REGOs).  Unfortunately  these  cannot  be guaranteed  to supply  
additional  renewable energy  and may utilise  current  renewable  electricity  on the 
grid, which  has been provided through subsidy  or obligation.  The Council  accepts  
the Energy  Saving  Trust  advice on this matter  and therefore  does not include  the 
notional  emissions  saved  from this approach  in its carbon  accounting.   
 
In respect  of offsetting  strategies,  the Council  takes  the view that local schemes  
that supply  communities  within the borough  of Reading  with renewable  energy  
and/or  carbon  reduction  through shareholding  held by the Council  or through other  
mechanisms  could  be acceptable,  and may have a part to play in our strategy  as we 
approach  'net zero' and have to tackle  the most difficult  residual  emissions  in the 
period beyond  2025.  However,  offsets which  lead to reductions in carbon  emissions  
in other  parts of the country  or internationally  are not currently  considered  
appropriate  due to the complexit y of interactions  with the national  grid and other  
government  policies,  international  conventions  and Ofgem  provisions,  hence  them  
not featuring  in our plan for 2020- 25. 
 
To achieve net zero carbon  by 2030, the organisation needs to have a generation 
capacity of at least 14 MWp. Currently the Council has a 2 MWp capacity. With an 
additional 5  MWp, the total generation output is predicted to be 5.6 MWh by 2025, 
which is equivalent to 48% of the organisation’ s total kWh energy use.  
Over the next five years, t he council therefore intends to follow a hierarchy o f 
sourcing electricity generation , as illustrated in Figure 4. 6 below. Classification: OFFICIAL

4.4 SMART  
 
4.4.1  Planning for the future  
As we go forwards local and national energy networks  will become more diverse with 
local renewable energy generation forming a much greater proportion of the energy 
mix. Alongside this, the capability to store electricity in batteries and heat in 
buildings gives us more flexibility on when this energy is used. T his is crucial when 
considering the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation.  
Whilst a Smart Council is crucial, it is mainly an enabling function to allow the other 
projects to work effectively and to strengthen business cases. For this reason n o 
incremental carbon savings are shown in this section. But the actions below will give 
us an increased utilisation of local renewable energy and help to reduce the carbon 
emissions associated with electricity supplied through the national grid.  
The Counci l will work with the University and other bodies on projects to increasingly 
align the Councils energy consumption with times when low or zero carbon energy 
are available. We will also look for ways to supply our communities with renewable 
energy when we d o not need it. As the Council will always need to be connected to 
the national grid via the local electricity network, we must, in the future, supply 
more renewable energy than we use to compensate for the carbon emissions of the 
energy we consume.  
Many of the technologies and services that we will need in this new era of nearly 
and net zero carbon operations are being developed and/or at trial stage and 
therefore the ‘Smart Council’ work during the 2020 to 2025 period will seek to 
establish a series  of projects and trials that can lead to reductions in carbon 
emissions but also establish further RBC owned renewable generation infrastructure 
that can help to supply our communities, as we already do for our Council tenants.

5. CONCLUSIONS  
Taken as a whole the strategy to reduce, decarbonise, generate and get smart have 
helped to inform the  action plan, which over the period of the strategy has the 
potential to reduce emissions by 85% compared to the  2008/9 baseline. This would 
leave us with carbon emissions of no greater than 3000 tonnes, less than hal f of our 
existing emissions  (see figures 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 below) , a level which would be in 
line with the expectations set in the Climate Emergency Declaration to achieve net 
zero carbon by 2030.  
A large number of variables remain in play -  the nature of our business and size of 
our estate going forwards in the light of the pandemic , the challenge of  forecas ting 
energy costs and network carbon intensity , the size of our capital programme and 
priorities within that. In view of these uncertainties, we cannot guarantee that this 
will be our precise trajectory  but we will retain the  ability to flex our plans in line 
with research and national developments . But we will also  have significant 
opportunities to use our low carbon investment to leverage in funding from national 
and other sources , and to ensure that this  investment drive the Council’s wider aim 
for a ‘green recovery’ from the impacts of COVID -19. 
The actions set out in this plan  will make good business sense as well as 
environmental sense, r educing future  revenue pressures and ensuring that the 
Council  is fit for the future and on track to a net zero carbon Reading, at the 
forefront of the UK and city governments worldwide in tackling climate change.
