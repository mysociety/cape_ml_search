BABERGH & MID SUFFOLK CABINETS’ RESPONSE TO THE PROPOSALS OF THE ENVIRONMENT & CLIMATE CHANGE TASK FORCE AND 
ACTIONS THAT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THEIR FIRST CARBON REDUCTION MANAGEMENT PLAN 
 
Introduction 
 
At full Council meetings on 23rd July 2019 and 25th July 2019 respectively Babergh & Mid Suffolk District Councils recognised the existence of a 
climate emergency and committed to investigating ways in which they could reduce their own emissions and to supporting the Suffolk-wide aim 
to become carbon neutral by 2030. Both Councils also agreed to establish a joint council, cross-party Environment and Climate Change Task 
Force to examine ways in which they could respond to the climate change challenge on a spend to save basis. The Task Force was established 
and its full findings are attached at Appendix F. The Task Force prioritised a number of proposals from the full list of possible actions and table 
two below shows: 
 
(a) The prioritised proposals from the Task Force; 
(b) Additional comments from Assistant Directors on viability, indicative costs and timescales; and 
(c) Comments from the Cabinets and whether each proposal from the Task Force is agreed or amended. 
  
The agreed actions, with noted amendments, in Table Two form the Councils’ first Carbon Reduction Management Plan. 
 
NOTE: The proposals specified in this plan are based predominantly on a ‘business as usual’ scenario.  However, at the time of drafting, the 
UK is in ‘lockdown’ in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  The implications of possible future restrictions to combat the disease are not 
known and could impact on some of the proposals detailed below.  
 
Many of the proposals require scoping and/or feasibility studies to determine viability, need, cost, timing or the extent of work required.  Table 
One defines the criteria used for estimating the costs and carbon savings or impact of such actions.

High – >£200k required for the project or approach Enabling – action will not save carbon directly but will help create an environment 
where other actions can take place to save carbon or create climate resilience 
 
Low – reduce carbon emissions in this area by <10% 
 
Medium – reduce carbon emissions in this area by between >10% and <25% 
 
High – reduce carbon emissions in this area by >25% 
 
Offset – action will create an offset 
 
Adaptation – action will help adapt to current and/or future impacts of climate change

1.1 We will explore opportunities 
for low carbon energy 
generation, with a view to 
minimising our reliance on the 
grid e.g. solar farms, solar car 
ports, battery storage. This will 
include options for Council-

feasibility work for

include assessment of 
battery storage at 
leisure sites. 
 Use ‘low carbon’ instead of 
‘renewable’ because this 
then includes nuclear 
energy. Nuclear energy is 
considered ‘low carbon’ 
because an operating plant 
emits virtually no CO2e but 
is not technically 
considered ‘renewable’ like 
wind or solar because the 
raw material (usually 
uranium-235) has a finite 
supply.

purchased by Abbeycroft Leisure

a prerequisite of any future

renewable energy supplier 
should confirm that their 
sources do not generate energy

 Summary  
These proposals set the foundations for how Babergh and Mid Suffolk District Councils will conduct its work going forward, in terms of its own 
responsibilities as well as its wider responsibility as an influencer. The plan has key actions that will take place in the short term, with the ability to start 
work immediately on longer term aspirations so that they can be timetabled into later versions of this action plan. There are clear actions around, energy, 
fuel and working remotely that will see the Councils working very differently within a year. Some actions require a change in culture, such as removing 
paper and working more virtually, which have already been key to continuing our work through the Covid-19 lockdown and so now more than ever we 
know that we can do this.
