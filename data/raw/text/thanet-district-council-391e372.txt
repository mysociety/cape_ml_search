Thanet District Council – Climate Change Action Plan 1 & 2
 
 
 
 
Climate Change Action Plan 1- Actions underway and committed
 
 
 
We are using this action plan as an initial  framework for our response to the climate and ecological emergency. This action plan provides an
 
outline of actions already in progress and this is a working document. Action Plan 2 contains all proposed actions not yet started or funded.
 
 
Areas of focus are those which are already outlined as headings within the Kent Environment Strategy.

TDC is committed to increasing
 
energy efficiency standards as
 
well as reducing the district's
 
carbon footprint. Currently TDC
 
is proposing to install 23.6 kWp
 
of solar panel systems across
 
the TDC Affordable Homes
 
Programme - Phase 3.  This will
 
result, in a reduction of approx
 
50,090 kg of carbon and a
 
generation of 18,202 kWh of

local authorities. This is a
 
challenging sector to engage
 
with, but the
 
learning could also influence
 
decisions made by private
 
householders that are able to
 
contribute
 
to the cost of measures. The
 
whole house approach will also
 
be trailed through some social
 
housing stock in the areas to
 
develop the supply chain more
 
rapidly.
 
Local businesses in the areas
 
will be encouraged to engage
 
with the project to develop the
 
supply chain as the pilot
 
increases the demand side.
 
Linkage with the local colleges
 
in terms of
 
skills development and a
