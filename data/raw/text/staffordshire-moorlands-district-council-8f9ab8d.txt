Cllr Joe Porter –Cabinet Member for Climate 
Change and Biodiversity, Staffordshire 
Moorlands District Council
The climate change nature crisis is the 
greatest threat that we face. It is a threat 
that impacts on all of us and on future 
generations. It is a threat that we need to 
respond to now, tomorrow and the days 
that follow with an unrelenting focus on 
preventing the emergencies.
This plan explains how Staffordshire 
Moorlands District Council will contribute 
towards Staffordshire Moorlands becoming 
carbon neutral.
We want to be ambitious, but we must also 
be realistic about what the district council 
can and cannot do. 
We need everyone to come together to 
play their part if we are going to meet the 
ambitious target of becoming Net Zero.We also need government to continue 
to build sustainability into key policies 
and laws such as the National Planning 
Policy Framework and Building Control 
Regulations. We need partners such as the 
County Council, which has responsibility 
for our roads, transport and education, to 
take a lead on the areas that they have 
responsibility for. Importantly, we also need 
our businesses, residents, community groups and visitors to play their part. We will do 
what we can to encourage a joined-up 
approach to tackling this vitally important 
issue that affects us all.
Please support our plan, we will only be 
able to tackle these emergencies if we work 
together. Every action that we can take, 
no matter how small can help. Let us all 
do what we can to respond to this global 
problem.

The Council’s decision to declare a climate 
emergency was unanimous and so is our 
resolve to tackle climate change. It is only 
by working together that we will achieve 
our target of being carbon neutral by 2030 
– and it is this sense of shared responsibility, 
collective unity and single purpose that 
underpins and gives strength to our goal.
Partnership is the key to success and we 
invite everyone who lives, learns or works 
in the Moorlands to join us in doing what 
they can to mitigate the impacts of climate 
change starting today. 
This document is intended to provide 
information, support and guidance to 
enable every one of us to play our part. It is 
amongst the most important things we will 
ever do.OuR VISION
Staffordshire Moorlands will 
become carbon neutral by 2030, 
taking into account emissions

cLIMATE cHANGE – OuR STRATEGY
Climate change is the greatest threat to our 
future existence. It is a global problem that 
requires global solutions. We know that we 
cannot solve the problem on our own, but 
we can take a lead role in our district and 
use our powers and influence to support 
wider local action to reduce emissions and 
prepare for a changing climate.
The District Council declared a climate 
emergency on 10th July 2019 following 
unanimous, cross-party backing, and 
committed to: ‘Start working with partners, across the district and region, towards making 
the Staffordshire Moorlands carbon neutral by 2030; taking into account 
emissions from both production and consumption’.
The declaration recognises that we need 
to work together, in partnership, to respond 
to the challenge of the climate change 
emergency.
It will require the Council to change the 
historic ways of heating and powering our 
buildings and vehicles, and the goods and 
services that we procure, when providing 
essential services for our communities. We will need to adopt zero and low carbon 
alternatives and put climate change at the 
centre of our decision making. 
In July 2021, the Council took the important 
step of approving its first Climate Change 
plan to set out how it intends to reduce 
emissions generated by the Council’s 
activities.
53cLIMATE cHANGE – OuR STRATEGY
AIMING LOW: THE WAY TO NET ZERO
But reducing the Council’s emissions is 
only a small part of the solution. We need 
to come together as district, so that all our 
residents, community groups and businesses 
are working together to respond to the 
emergency. 
“It comes down, I think, to us 
each taking responsibility for the 
personal choices in our everyday 
lives. That’s all any of us can be 
expected to do. And it is those 
everyday choices that add up”
Dr Jon Copley, University of Southampton
This plan sets out the role that the District 
Council can play in encouraging this 
collective action, from ensuring that local 
plans support sustainable development, 
to working in partnership with other 
organisations, to promoting good ideas 
and supporting our local community to get 
involved.The plan sets out the first steps of the 
journey. We will update it over time to take 
advantage of new ideas and opportunities, 
and to respond to any new legislation 
and guidance, funding opportunities or 
challenges. It’s the first steps of a long 
journey but we believe that we can get there 
if we work together.
• We recognise the global climate 
emergency.
• We are committed to keeping global 
heating below the 1.5°Celsius goal of the 
Paris Agreement.
• We are committed to putting inclusive 
climate action at the centre of our 
decision-making to create thriving and 
equitable communities for everyone.
• We pledge to reach Net Zero by 2030 in 
line with global efforts to limit warming to 
1.5°Celsius.• We invite our partners – political, business 
and community leaders; statutory 
organisations; trade unions; civic society 
and community members – to join us in 
recognising the global climate emergency 
and help us deliver on science-based 
action to overcome it.
• We invite everyone within Staffordshire 
Moorlands to act today and implement at 
least one measure to reduce their carbon 
footprint.

GLOBAL RISKS 
In 2020, the World Economic Forum (WEF) identified the top 5 global risks 
based on their likelihood of happening. All of the top 5 were environmental: 
extreme weather, climate action failure, natural disasters, biodiversity loss, 
and human-made environmental disasters. No environmental risk made the 
top 5 prior to 2011.
Three of the WEF’s top five global risks based on the impact that they would 
have were also environmental (climate action failure, biodiversity loss and 
extreme weather). The societal impact of water crises also featured in the 
top 5, alongside the risks associated with weapons of mass destruction.
The Global Risks Report 2020, World Economic Forum
Greenhouse gases – or GHGs - are 
released during many of the activities that 
we do day-to-day, such as driving petrol 
cars or heating homes. It is also released 
– or emitted - by industry. We call these 
‘emissions’. Carbon dioxide ( CO2) is the most common GHG that is created by human 
activity– mainly through the burning of fossil 
fuels such as coal and gas. CO2 tends to 
remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of 
years.The amount of Greenhouse gases from 
human activity have increased sharply 
since the industrial revolution especially in 
recent decades. This tips the ‘carbon cycle’ 
(where natural emissions of CO2 equal those 
removed) out of balance and increases the 
amount in the atmosphere.
GHGs trap heat in the atmosphere. The 
amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is now 
at its highest in several million years, and 
research shows that the heat trapped by this 
and other GHGs is increasing the average 
global temperature. This is called global 
warming..

“Global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C 
will be exceeded during the 21st 
century unless deep reductions in 
carbon dioxide ( CO2) and other 
greenhouse gas emissions occur 
in the coming decades” 
Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science 
Basis, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC). 
Climate change is the changes in global 
weather patterns that are driven by global 
warming. The risks from climate change 
include:
• Extreme weather events.
• Environmental and economic damage.
• Further sea level rise as major ice sheets 
melt.
• Risks to health and wellbeing from 
poor equality, exposure to extreme 
temperatures, etc.• Severe impacts on the world’s poorest 
and most vulnerable populations.
• Disruption and irreversible loss of natural 
habitats and resources.
A GLOBAL PROBLEM –  
LOcAL IMPAcTS
• Extreme weather events increase the risk 
of flooding and damage to the transport 
network. For example, the River Churnet 
burst its banks in several areas in 2019 
leading to flooding of an industrial 
estate, golf course and other areas and 
suspension of services by Churnet Valley 
Railway. Surface water also blocked 
several major roads throughout the 
district.
• Increasing temperatures and severe 
weather events induced by climate 
change will directly and indirectly result 
in habitat alterations and increase the 
vulnerability of animal and plant species. 
Sphagnum moss is especially susceptible 
to environmental changes and faces extinction in the event of severe climatic 
changes. By 2080, climate change may 
result in the loss of moorland birds, such 
as merlin and golden plover, from the 
Dark Peak.
• Drier conditions may result in rivers and 
streams becoming increasingly seasonal 
and at risk of drying up, with the risk 
of losing ponds altogether, especially 
dew ponds. The danger of wildfires 
also increases as peat soils dry out and 
woodlands suffer from summer drought. 
In the summer of 2018, major fires broke 
out in the Thorncliffe and Roaches area of 
the district. Residents were evacuated and 
it estimated that the Roaches fire released 
over 11,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide 
(CO2), equivalent to running 1,426 homes 
for one year.

GLOBAL
Each of the last four decades has been 
successively warmer than any decade 
that preceded it since 1850. Global surface 
temperature was 1.09°C higher in 2011–2020 
than 1850–1900. Models predict that Earth 
will warm between 2 and 6°C in the next 
century.
The levels of emissions have increased 
dramatically since the end of World War 
II. The fastest rate of increase in the 20th 
century was in the 25 years leading up to 
1970, with an annual average rate of more 
than 5%. Since 1970 it has been around 2%.uNITEd KINGdOM (uK): 
In 2018, UK emissions were estimated to 
be 451.5 million tonnes carbon dioxide 
equivalent (Mt CO2e).
The UK’s ten warmest years on record have 
occurred since 2002 and seven of the ten 
wettest years on record have happened 
since 1998. Heatwaves are now 30 times more likely 
to happen in the UK due to climate change 
and the Met Office predict that, at current 
rates, heatwaves in the UK can be expected 
to happen every other year by 2050. Winter 
storms are at least 40% more likely because 
of climate change.

linked to the production of goods that 
are consumed in the UK but produced 
abroad or the UK’s ‘share’ of emissions from 
international aviation and shipping). Half 
of the total cut in emissions since 1990 were 
from the energy supply sector (mainly power 
generation). Gas replaced coal for electricity 
generation during the 1990s, renewables 
(especially wind) grew in the 2010s and coal 
use has fallen further in recent years to just 
2% of generation. Energy supply emissions 
are now below those from transport which

of 5% by the period 2008-12.
PARIS 
12 dEcEMBER 2015: 
The Paris Agreement - a legally binding 
international treaty on climate change- was 
adopted. Its goal is to limit global warming 
to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees 
Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.Why 1.5?
Climate Change and Biodiversity: 
Limiting global warming to 
1.5°C above pre-industrial levels 
avoids half the risks associated 
with warming of 2 °C for plants, 
animals, and insects in terms of 
climate change induced range 
loss.
Climate Change and Human 
Health: 
With 1.5 °C of future global 
warming, many tropical and sub-
tropical regions will face extreme 
risks to population health from 
heat stress. These risks become 
widespread in these regions with 
temperature increases of 2.5 °C to 
3°C.Climate Change and Sea Level 
Rise: 
Global sea level rises are 
predicted to rise by up to 52cm by 
2100 with a temperature rise of 
1.5°C and up to 63cm for a 2.0°C 
rise. The additional 11 cm of sea 
level rise is projected to result in 
additional global annual flood 
costs of US$ 1.5 trillion per year 
(0.25% of global GDP) without 
adaptation. Flood cost for UK is 
projected to increase from 2.5% of 
GDP (1.5°C) to 4% GDP(2°C).

10TH JuLY 2019: 
The Council declared a climate emergency 
and agreed to work with partners across the 
district and beyond to make Staffordshire 
Moorlands carbon neutral by 2030. 
This means that by 2030 any greenhouse 
gas emissions from the district must be 
balanced with an equivalent amount of 
emissions that are collected and stored in a 
way that keeps them safe (sequestered) or 
offset. If we do this, we become a carbon 
neutral district with a net zero carbon 
footprint.8 OcTOBER 2019: 
The Council approved a new corporate plan 
(2019-23) that included “Protect and improve 
the environment and respond to the climate 
emergency” as one of the four aims of the 
Council. The Council’s corporate plan has 
previously included aims around improving 
the environment, but this is the first time that 
climate change has been specifically named 
a key aim. This demonstrates the Council’s

29 JuNE 2021: 
The District Council approved its 2021/22 
Climate Change Plan (Part 1), which 
focussed on reducing the Council’s own 
emissions.
Following the declaration of a climate 
emergency, the Council introduced a 
Climate Change Sub Committee to help 
develop its plans. Working groups met to 
look at district greenhouse gas emissions 
from Council activity, housing, industry, 
agriculture, land use and biodiversity, waste, 
and energy production. These working 
groups gathered evidence from many 
outside agencies and experts to identify 
actions that could reduce emissions.
A group of Council Officers also met to 
develop ideas and create the plan.We also considered information from the 
following sources when creating our plan:
• Research conducted on our behalf by 
Anthesis
• The results of a Climate Change Attitude 
carried out in September 2021. 
• Consultation with DEFRA, UK100, APSE, 
businesses, Keele University and other 
stakeholders, and other meetings 
conducted by the Cabinet Member for 
Climate Change and Biodiversity.
• A review of national and international 
guidance, and local authority plans from 
across the country.
The Council has reviewed its structures and 
the skills and capacity of the workforce that 
are needed to deliver its plans. It will also 
build the cost of delivering the Council’s 
actions within the plan into the Council’s 
annual budget and Medium-Term Financial 
Plan.The Council carries an earmarked reserve 
set aside for initiatives responding to the 
Climate Emergency. This reserve is available 
to provide the funding for unbudgeted in-
year spend developing projects designed 
to further the Council’s ambitions around 
climate change. Once specific projects 
have been developed (and their business 
case signed off); the necessary budget 
requirements can be incorporated into the 
Medium Term Financial Plan.

AIMING LOW: THE WAY TO NET ZERO
We have used this list as a framework for 
creating our plans to achieve net zero in 
Staffordshire Moorlands by 2030.  
“As much as 62% of the future 
reduction in emissions will rely on 
individual choices and behaviours, 
from day to day lifestyle choices 
to one off purchases such as 
replacing boilers that use fossil 
fuels or buying an electric vehicle”.
House of Commons Public Accounts 
Committee 2021, Achieving Net Zero“The public need to be involved – 
over half the emissions reductions 
we identified to reach Net Zero 
actively involve people, whether 
by choosing to purchase low-
carbon technologies like electric 
cars, or by making different 
choices, for example on their 
travel and diets.”

AIMING LOW: THE WAY TO NET ZERO
Some actions that we can take are better 
than others at producing more lasting 
reductions in emissions. We call this the 
Carbon Management Hierarchy. In our plan, 
we will look at ways of avoiding emissions 
before we think about ways of removing or 
offsetting.
THE cARBON MANAGEMENT 
HIERARcHYWe acknowledge that climate change is 
a ‘grand challenge’ but it also presents 
opportunities. This includes improving 
people’s health and wellbeing through 
active travel and cleaner air, using nature-
based solutions to improve people’s quality 
of life, tackling deprivation by addressing 
food and fuel poverty, improving our natural 
environment through the protection and 
expansion of green spaces; and delivering 
economic growth and creating jobs. These 
are often referred to as the co-benefits of 
tackling climate change. We will look for 
opportunities to deliver co-benefits wherever 
possible.Clean growth is one of the four Grand 
Challenges set out in the UK’s Industrial 
Strategy.
“We will maximise the advantages 
for UK industry from the global 
shift to clean growth – through 
leading the world in the 
development, manufacture and 
use of low carbon technologies, 
systems and services that cost less 
than high carbon alternatives.”

1 THE WAY WE LIVE
WHY IS THIS A PRIORITY?
Emissions from residential buildings totalled 
169 kt CO2e within Staffordshire Moorlands 
in 2018. This figure estimates emissions 
arising from the consumption of energy 
in residential buildings of all types and 
tenures, including social housing, rented 
accommodation and privately-owned 
properties. 
The most significant source of emissions 
from households comes from the use of 
energy for heating and hot water. Most 
of this is achieved through natural gas 
consumption, with gas demand for heating 
making up 51% of residential building 
emissions. The second most significant 
source of emissions is the use of grid 
supplied electricity to the district for lighting, 
appliances and cooking, which makes up around 19% of residential emissions. The 
remainder is made up of small contributions 
from other fuel types.
In 2019, official figures show that 16.2% of 
households in Staffordshire Moorlands 
were living in fuel poverty (compared to an 
average of 13.8% for the whole of England). 
WHAT ARE OuR TARGETS?
10% of households will be living in fuel 
poverty by 2025 and 0% by 2030.
There will be Net Zero emissions from 
residential buildings by 2030.

2 THE WAY WE TRAVEL
WHY IS THIS A PRIORITY?
Transport is the largest emitting sector of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, producing 
27% of the UK’s total emissions in 2019. Of 
this, the majority (91%) came from road 
transport vehicles. The biggest contributors 
to this were cars and taxis, which made up 
61% of the emissions from road transport, 
followed by Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) 
(18%) and vans (17%).
International aviation emissions (which are 
not counted towards the UK’s total domestic 
emissions) have more than doubled in the 
period 1990- 2019 (a 138% increase).
Emissions from transport totalled 150 kt CO2e 
in 2018. On-road transport dominates the 
emissions in this sector; Department for 
Transport data indicate that over 4.7 billion 
vehicle miles were driven across the district’s 
roads in 2018. The proportion of electric 
vehicles in the district has grown significantly in recent years, but still constitutes less 
than 1% of the overall number of registered 
vehicles.
Approximately 79% of people aged 16-74

industrial buildings in 2018.
The most significant source of emissions 
from non-residential buildings is coal 
consumption in industrial buildings. 
Contributions from coal consumption make 
up approximately 35% of all non-residential 
buildings emissions. As with residential 
buildings, the next most significant

WHY IS THIS A PRIORITY?
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 
the power sector were 65 Mt CO2 in 2018, 
which is 15% of the UK total. These emissions 
come from the burning of coal and gas 
for electricity, with a small proportion 
from oil and other small-scale embedded 
generation: Gas plants contribute to 70% of 
power emissions. They provide 40% of total 
electricity generation. Coal accounts for 
23% of emissions but only 5% of generation. 
The remaining 7% of emissions come from 
oil and a variety of other small generation 
sources (Climate Change Committee, The

5 THE WAY WE LOOK AFTER OuR ENVIRONMENT
WHY IS THIS A PRIORITY?
Climate change can have a devastating 
impact on our natural environment, but 
restoring and improving nature can help us 
to reduce emissions.
Well-functioning, fertile soils maintain our 
food and timber supply. They store carbon 
and support a diverse range of organisms 
that form part of the terrestrial food chain 
for wildlife
UK peatlands are one of the most important 
terrestrial natural stores for carbon. They 
are estimated to store over 25 times the UK’s 
total current annual emissions and store an 
order of magnitude higher than the carbon 
stored in trees. However, the area of land 
suitable for peat forming vegetation in the 
uplands could decline by between 50% and 
65% by the 2050sThe abundance and distribution of UK 
terrestrial and freshwater species has 
declined by 13% since 1970. Upland areas 
face particularly acute risks, with 75% of 
present-day upland species potentially 
facing a decline in climate suitability by the 
end of the century under a medium level of 
warming
Particulate matter with an aerodynamic 
diameter of 2.5µm or less (PM2.5) has 
a significant impact on human health, 
including premature mortality, allergic 
reactions, and cardiovascular diseases. The 
2019 fraction of mortality attributable to 
PM2.5 pollution in Staffordshire Moorlands is 
4.8%, which is below the national average of 
5.1%. There are two areas within Staffordshire 
Moorlands where air pollution exceeds that 
target values for the protection of human 
health. These are known as Air Quality 
Management Areas (AQMA) and the two 
areas are Leek town centre and Cellarhead 
crossroads.The major contributors to NO2 (Nitrogen 
Dioxide) in both AQMAs are Cars, Light Duty 
Vehicles and Heavy Duty Vehicles.
The percentage tree cover for the district is 
14.35 with urban tree cover in Staffordshire 
Moorlands is estimated to be around 17-19%
WHAT ARE OuR TARGETS?
Mortality attributable to PM2.5 pollution 
across the District will remain below the 
national average.
Annual mean nitrogen dioxide (NO2) will 
be reduced by 25.5 µg/m3 In Leek and 
by 34.6 µg/m3 in Cellarhead by 2030
There will be 20% urban canopy cover 
by 2025 and 24% by 2030.

WHY IS THIS A PRIORITY?
Emissions from waste from the district 
totalled 12 kt CO2e in 2018. This includes Solid 
waste disposal emissions and wastewater 
emissions. According to DEFRA statistics 
for 2018/19, Staffordshire Moorlands saw 
a recycling rate of 56%, with an average of 
396kg of collected waste per resident.
56% of household waste is reused, recycled, 
or composted in the district. The target for 
residual waste per household was 475kg in 
2021/22.WHAT ARE OuR TARGETS?
58% of waste will be reused, recycled or 
composted by 2025.
There will be 465 kg or less residual 
waste per household in 2021/22
There will be Net Zero emissions from 
waste by 2030.

Energy Efficiency Measures
ELEcTRIc VEHIcLES (EV)
Electric vehicles are powered by electric 
motors. They get some or all their power 
from large, rechargeable batteries. Different 
categories include: 
All-electric EVs, where the battery is the only 
power source.
Plug-in Hybrids (PHEVs), which can switch 
between running on electricity or fossil fuels.
Hybrids (HEVs) which do not plug in and 
have a much smaller battery which is 
recharged while driving.
Fuel Cell Vehicles that generate their own 
electricity on-board from a fuel such as 
hydrogen.EV cHARGING
There are three main types of charger:
Slow  Typically rated up to 3kW with a 
charge time of 8-10 hours
Fast Typically rated at either 7kW or 22kW 
with a charge time of 3-4 hours
Rapid  Typically rated from 43kW with a 
charge time of 30-60 mins (only compatible 
with EVs with a rapid charging capability)
The choice of connectors depends on the 
charger type (socket) and the vehicle’s 
inlet port. On the charger-side, rapid 
chargers use CHAdeMO, CCS (Combined 
Charging Standard) or Type 2 connectors. 
Fast and slow units usually use Type 2, 
Type 1, Commando, or 3-pin plug outlets. 
On the vehicle-side, European EV models 
(Audi, BMW, Renault, Mercedes, VW and 
Volvo) tend to have Type 2 inlets and the 
corresponding CCS rapid standard, while 
Asian manufacturers (Nissan and Mitsubishi) 
prefer a Type 1 and CHAdeMO inlet 
combination.

EMISSIONS
Emissions are things (in this cases gases) 
that are given off or released into the air 
from things like factories and cars.
For our purposes, it is the release of the 
seven greenhouse gases specified in the 
Kyoto Protocol.
ENERGY EFFIcIENcY
Using less energy to do the same thing, 
such as heat a home. This can lower fuel 
consumption, reduce emissions and help 
tackle climate change. Measures to improve 
energy efficiency within buildings can 
include the installation of loft or cavity wall 
insulation (improving the energy efficiency 
of the building) or installing new appliances 
that are more energy-efficient (such as new 
heating systems).EPc RATING  
ENERGY PERFORMANcE 
cERTIcATE (EPc)
This shows how much a building will cost 
to heat and light, what its carbon dioxide 
emissions are likely to be and what 
improvements can be made to improve its 
energy efficiency. An EPC rates a property 
in bands from A (most efficient) to G (least 
efficient) and is valid for 10 years from the 
date it’s issued. 
FOSSIL FuELS
A fuel (oil, coal or gas) that was formed from 
the remains of living organisms millions of 
years ago. Fossil fuels are non-renewable 
energy resources which are harmful for the 
environment because they release carbon 
dioxide, and other greenhouse gases and 
harmful air-polluting gases, when they burn.GLOBAL WARMING
Global warming is the term used to describe 
the rising of the average temperature on 
Earth. It has to do with the overall climate

WHAT cAN I dO?
You can eliminate waste, reduce your 
carbon footprint and start making an impact 
right away by committing to some or all 
of the following actions. This isn’t a list of 
everything that you can do but we hope it 
gives you some ideas.
FOOd
• Set a goal of reducing the food waste in 
your home from its current levels.
• Commit to only buying what you need 
and eat what you buy.
• Avoid air-freighted food when they are 
out of season.
• Buy local food and support the local 
economy.
• Don’t leave the house without a reusable 
cup.ELEcTRIcITY
• Take basic steps that cost nothing: turn 
lights off, hang washing out to dry, wash 
at a lower temperature and keep showers 
short. 
• Wear a jumper rather than turn the heat 
up, turn the thermostat down and turn 
radiators off in empty rooms (if you can 
without risking your health).
• Seek help if you are struggling to keep 
warm
• If you can afford to invest in your home, 
prioritise the carbon cutting measures 
that have the biggest impact: insulation 
(starting with drafts, then the loft, 
windows and walls), smart heating 
(efficient boilers, remote controls that 
include radiators), and lastly considering 
solar panels or heat pumps.• Consider options for buying electricity 
from a green energy provider if they can 
demonstrate that your bill goes entirely 
towards additional renewable power.
TRANSPORTATION
• Aim to fly less and support your local 
economy through staycations
• Cut car emissions by walking, cycling, 
using public transport, car sharing or 
working from home.
• Consider buying an electric or plug-in 
hybrid if you can and only if you need a 
new car. 
3WHAT cAN I dO?
AIMING LOW: THE WAY TO NET ZERO
PuRcHASES 
• Consume less
• Consume wisely. Consider the supply 
chain and think about the carbon 
footprint, fair livelihoods and all other 
sustainability criteria. 
• Buy local.
• Buy high quality things where you can 
and make them last, buy things that are 
designed to be repairable and sell on or 
give away when you have finished with 
them.
• Choose the most energy-efficient white 
goods. INVESTMENTS
• Use any money you have to help create 
the future you want to see.
• Look at options for investing in pension 
and saving schemes that don’t support 
fossil fuel companies and prioritise those 
that invest in the things we urgently need, 
such as renewables and reforestation.“Very few of us are squeaky clean 
in carbon terms. You don’t have 
to become so overnight but most 
of us do need to make serious 
changes over the next few years. 
It’s important to keep moving in 
the right direction and enjoy the 
process of cutting carbon out of 
our lives. Don’t beat yourself up, 
but don’t let yourself off the hook 
either.”

Adopt the 5 R’s
• Refuse – say no to the stuff 
that you don’t need and that 
becomes instant waste
• Reduce – what do you 
actually need, how much do 
you need, how long it will

or repair it before throwing 
stuff away?
• Recycle – aim for 
products that can be
