about Climate ChangePAGE   2Foreword
Climate change represents a significant threat to our future 
and preventing and protecting ourselves from climate change is a top priority.
Recent extreme weather events over several years have 
presented severe challenges to property, transport, agriculture and other services in the Sefton area and have led to the deaths and displacement of thousands of people worldwide.
The Meteorological Office clearly states that these kind 
of extreme weather events are significantly more 
likely if we take no action on reducing our carbon 
emissions; the main driver of man-made climate change.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) is the United Nations body for assessing 
the science related to climate change. In their 
report “Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change 1.5C report”, published in October 
2018, they conclude that humanity has 11 
years for “ambitious action from national and 
sub-national authorities, civil society, the 
private sector, indigenous peoples and local communities” to deliver the “rapid and far reaching transitions in land, energy, industry, 
buildings, transport, and cities” needed to 
turn this around, so we can avoid reaching 
tipping points where we would no longer have 
the ability to avoid extreme weather events.Children in Sefton will be in their teens and twenties in 11 years’ time. They deserve a liveable Sefton. We must act now to ensure this. Bold climate action can deliver economic benefits in terms of new jobs, economic savings and market opportunities, as well as improved wellbeing for people locally and worldwide.
Work on reducing carbon emissions does not start from a 
zero base. Sefton has been involved with numerous projects aimed at reducing emissions and will continue to do so, in the context of the climate emergency and with increased urgency.
This strategy sets out our vision and broad aims and objectives 
and represents our commitment to maximise the opportunity within climate action and to protect our communities from that damage already caused by climate change.
It will be followed by a series of implementation plans which 
will detail our journey towards net zero carbon operations by 2030.
We will report our progress in a series of Annual Reports, 
detailing actions taken so far and progress towards our 2030 net zero carbon target. The first of these will be available in July 2020.
We are committed to taking responsibility for our carbon 
emissions and playing our part in limiting global average temperature rises.  Business as usual is no longer an option.

about Climate ChangeIntroduction
Climate change represents a major threat to our planet, its 
people and its wildlife and the vast majority of the scientific 
community agree that urgent action must be taken to halt this change.
The climate has changed over millions of years; however, human 
activity and the burning of fossil fuels has caused the rate of 
change to increase.
This is not a prospect for our distant future, this change is 
happening now. The planet has already experienced abnormal heating of 1
oC and the damaging impacts of climate change are 
already being felt across the world by animals and humans alike.
This strategy aims to ensure that Sefton plays its part in limiting 
global average temperature rises and responding to this 
significant threat to our planet.Sefton’s Climate Change Emergency Plan

about Climate ChangePAGE  4Context
The Sefton Council Climate Emergency Strategy has been developed in 
response to the declaration of a Climate Change Emergency on the 18th 
July 2019 by Sefton Council.
It will provide the basis for the development of future plans and 
represents a commitment from Sefton Council to taking on the Climate 
Change Emergency.
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is 
the leading global authority on climate change.
In 2018, the IPCC produced a report which stated that governments had 
12 years to make significant changes in order to limit average global 
temperature rise to 1.5oC.
The voice of the global public has added to this pressure in recent years and this activism has prompted climate emergency declarations across 
the global
Sefton Council joins 60% of UK local authorities in declaring a climate 
emergency and a growing consensus worldwide that urgent action is 
needed.
Sefton cannot tackle climate change alone, but joining this community is 
an important step.Sefton’s Climate Change Emergency Plan

and Sefton
As a coastal borough, Sefton feels the effects of climate change more 
keenly than other parts of the UK.
The impacts for Sefton from a changing climate include, more extreme 
weather events. This could include warmer and wetter winters, hotter and 
drier summers, more frequent and intense storms and increased coastal 
flooding and erosion.
Work has been ongoing to prepare Sefton for extreme weather. The 
Shoreline Management Plan sets the coastal defence policy for up to 100 
years. However, the deliverability of these policies will be affected by the changes in the climate.
Extreme weather will impact negatively on our communities and 
businesses and we must do all in our power to reduce the likelihood of an extreme weather event.
Sefton has a wealth of urban and open space that can be adapted to 
mitigate some of the predicted climate impacts. The opportunities exist 
to not only to mitigate climate impacts but also contribute to biodiversity and human health and wellbeing0600 0700 0800 0900 1000 1100 1200 1300

Sefton Council will focus its efforts on energy use reduction as well as 
exploring the potential for green infrastructure and offsetting.
We will approach this as an opportunity, not a challenge and ensure our 
whole community reaps the benefits of climate action.
This work will be aligned to the delivery of the Sefton 2030 Vision and the 
Council’s Core Purpose with the aim of making Sefton a better place to live 
and work.Sefton’s Climate Change Emergency Plan PAGE  7

Sefton Council have clear objectives for our climate action:
	To have established a clear baseline and full audit of all 
ongoing work that can contribute to the achievement of our net zero target.
	To have developed ambitious yet achievable targets for each of our proposed action plans based on our baseline evidence.
	To have achieved net carbon zero by 2030 and ensure all strategic decisions are in line with this target.
	To have raised awareness of the issues across the Council, our partners and our communities.
	To have engaged with young people and the wider community.
	To have embedded climate action and value into our decision making across the organisation.0600 0700 0800 0900 1000 1100 1200 1300

about Climate ChangeApproach
Sefton Council will define its emissions according to the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol. This is the standard mechanism by 
which governments and local authorities measure and define 
their emissions.
Scope 1: Direct emissions which occur from sources that 
are owned or controlled by Sefton Council. E.g. Gas
Scope 2: Indirect emissions from the emissions generated 
when fuel is burned for the benefit of Sefton Council. E.g. Electricity
Scope 3: Indirect emissions which occur as a consequence 
of the activities of organisation. E.g. the extraction and 
production of purchased materials; transportation of purchased fuels; staff travel.
Sefton Council’s Climate Emergency Declaration instructs the 
Council to make ‘council operations’ net zero carbon by 2030. 
This translates directly to Scope 1 and 2 against the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
The declaration calls for wider action beyond the boundaries 
of our organisation. Therefore, work begins on measuring and addressing the emissions in Scope 3 and engaging with our 
community and partners to encourage vital action.This strategy represents our broad direction of travel over the 
next decade on the journey to achieving net zero carbon by 
2030 for council wide activities. Following this strategy, action 
plans will be produced detailing action to be taken to achieve our aims and strategic objectives.
Our immediate tasks are as follows:
 ■ Establish a baseline figure for the carbon emissions of 
Sefton Council
 ■ Identify all current projects that are taking place across the council that will support the delivery of the Council’s Strategy
 ■ Consider and define how the Sefton Strategy and implementation plan will align with the Liverpool City Region work being undertaken and that of key partners, for 
example, MerseyTravel, Merseyside Pension Fund
 ■ Develop and resource the first 3-year implementation plan 
(2020-2023)
 ■ Provide the first Annual Report to Council in July 2020.Sefton’s Climate Change Emergency Plan PAGE  10
