Manchester  
Climate Change Strategy 2017-50
Implementation Plan 2017-22Implementation Plan 2017-22
Manchester’s Climate Change Strategy for 2017-50 sets 
out the commitment for the city to play its full part in limiting the impacts of global climate change, locally and globally and to become zero carbon, zero waste, and climate resilient by 2050. The strategy has five headline objectives: sustainable economy and jobs; healthy communities; resilience to climate change; zero carbon; culture change.
Implementation plans set out the actions to be 
delivered within a given five-year period, to both make progress against the strategy’s objectives and to undertake preparatory work that will enable progress to be made in future five-year periods. The actions in these plans are the strategic actions that will help to drive, enable and support Manchester’s physical and cultural transformation to 2050 and beyond. By their nature, these actions will need to be delivered by key organisations and partnerships in the city.
In addition to the actions set out in implementation 
plans, residents, schools, colleges, third sector organisations and businesses all have a critically important role to play, as part of their day-to-day lives and operations. This collective action is key to the strategy’s successful delivery. Further information on how stakeholders can get involved and benefit from action on climate change is at: www.manchesterclimate.com/getinvolved 
This is the strategy’s first Implementation Plan. It is structured according to the sections in the strategy, to ensure that the strategy’s commitments are transparently and clearly being taken forward. A number of the actions are based on those set out in the Greater Manchester Climate Change Strategy Implementation Plan 2017-20, recognising that, rather than creating new Manchester-specific actions, it will be more effective in some areas for Manchester to participate fully in city-region-wide programmes. This implementation plan should be read alongside GM climate change plans for a complete view of the strategic climate change actions to be delivered in Manchester over the next five years.
