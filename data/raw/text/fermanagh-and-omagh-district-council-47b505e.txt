Summary  This document sets out Fermanagh and Omagh District Council’s Climate Change and  
Sustainable Development Action Plan from 2021 - 2024. It describes why we need to  
act now, how we are going to achieve the outcomes of our Climate Change and Sustainable  
Development  Strategy and our rigorous approach for the first three years. 
Energy efficient buildings  
and local zero carbon energy

and water efficient appliances 
will help reduce water demandThe Headlines
The Council commits  
to achieving:
• Net zero by 2040 in the 
Council’s operations
• Net zero by 2042 in the District
• Climate resilience in our 
buildings, public spaces and 
infrastructureAcross the District  
we will:
• Work with all stakeholder groups 
to accelerate the transition to 
net zero
• Work with our partners to make  
the District more resilient to  
extreme weather and floodingAt the Council we will do this  
through major investment in:
• Improving energy efficiency  
in Council buildings
• Encouraging net zero through  
our supply chain
• Enhancing carbon removal in  
our open spaces
• Protecting our shared natural  
resources
• Integrating climate 
considerations  
into all our decisions  Our vision:
The Fermanagh and Omagh District is inclusive,  
sustainable, resilient and competitive.
Net zero is the balance between the amount  
of greenhouse gas produced and the amount  
removed from the atmosphere.
04
Who we are
The Fermanagh and Omagh District spans approximately 3,000 km2  
and is home to 117,400 people. The District is primarily rural and shares a  
bio-geographical border with the Republic of Ireland, with border counties  
including Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Sligo.
Our reach extends well beyond the Council’s services, across private, public  
and community sectors to jointly deliver better outcomes for everyone.  
We have a duty to promote the wellbeing of the area, working with our  
partners to improve the quality of life for all our citizens. As climate change 
represents a significant threat to our society, economy and natural heritage,  
we recognise we have a vital role to play in leading efforts to tackle it.
Our reach extends well beyond the Council’s services, across the private,  
public and community sectors to jointly deliver better outcomes for everyone.
05What we can do
06
In the context of climate action, there must be clear and decisive leadership. 
Although we cannot act alone, we believe it is right that the Council takes 
responsibility and co-ordinates efforts to support the achievement of net 
zero, build climate resilience and grow a sustainable economy to achieve  
a truly sustainable District. 
We will do this by means of the following actions, committed to in our 
Climate Change and Sustainable Development Strategy 2020 – 2030, 
against which we drive our performance.

0708Why us?  
Why now?
The Council’s core purpose is to promote the long-term interests of the District,  
thereby supporting our citizens, the economy and the environment. We have long  
been champions of sustainability. We were the first local government body to  
introduce 100% electric vehicles into our fleet in 2013. 
The Climate Change Resilience Group was established in 2019 and the Climate Change and Sustainable 
Development Cross Directorate Group was established in 2020. Since then, we have published a 10-year 
Sustainable Development and Climate Change Strategy which we hope will guide us to a more sustainable 
future and end our contribution to climate change.
Scientific evidence tells us that the climate is already changing. We need to act now if we are to limit global 
warming to 1.5 degrees, thereby avoiding the more extreme effects of climate change. This means we 
must commit to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions as a Council and supporting a District-wide 
transition to net zero. And we must ensure that the Council, and its assets, are resilient to more extreme 
weather events. Acting now is the right and responsible thing to do. It is also key to securing and supporting 
our local economy and protecting our rural communities. It will also strengthen the appeal of our District and 
public spaces within it as attractive places to work, live, study and visit, both now and in the future. 
We do not need to compromise the economy to fix the environment. We believe a circular, zero carbon 
economy can facilitate prosperity and create jobs. In order to remain viable, we need to be both climate 
responsible and climate resilient. 
Cllr Errol Thompson  
Chair of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council
“The time for debate and discussion 
is over, we now need commitment 
and action from all sectors, and this 
begins with the Council.” Why us?  
Why now?
Integrating climate risks and opportunities into corporate decision-making  
is becoming more routine. In developing this Plan and in future iterations,  
we will focus on achieving best practice driven by an evidence-based approach.
We will strive to include as broad a range of emission sources and physical risks as possible.  
Our Climate Action Plan aims to ensure that the Council makes a positive contribution by striving  
to be ambitious and leading by example. We will help tackle climate change, address the risks it  
poses, and seize the opportunities presented by leading the transition to a net zero economy locally. 
This is one of the defining cross-Council Plans. It supports delivery of our Corporate Plan, 2020-24,  
and Community Plan ‘Fermanagh and Omagh 2030’. But we cannot do this alone. This Plan sets out  
how we will work in partnership with our stakeholders to develop the solutions needed to tackle  
climate change. We must build back better following the pandemic, making sure no one is left behind.  
We invite you to work with us as we adapt so that our society can flourish for decades to come. 
Alison McCullagh  
Chief Executive, Fermanagh and Omagh District Council
“We commit to achieving net zero 
and to ensuring that the Council 
and its assets are resilient to more 
extreme weather events.” Our approach 
We cannot fulfil our ambitions alone and we will work in collaboration 
with others to deliver positive climate action. We will work with partners 
in the Statutory, Community, Business and Voluntary Sectors to achieve 
our aims. However, this also means we must first demonstrate robust 
climate action ourselves.
Our process
The methodology used to develop this plan was based on the International  
Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) Five Milestone Approach.  
It is a ‘plan, do, check, act’ process designed specifically for the development  
of local authority Climate Change Action Plans.

Whatever action we and others take, we still need 
to prepare for warmer wetter winters, hotter drier 
summers, stronger winds, more frequent extreme 
weather events and rising sea levels. As we do this,  
we will go beyond mitigation of risk and seize 
opportunities to deliver social, economic, and 
environmental outcomes that mean that  
everyone benefits from the action we take.

others’ efforts 
This Plan has been developed to support the 
delivery of the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals (2015), The Paris Agreement on 
Climate Change (2015) and our obligations 
under the UK Climate Change Act (amended 
2019). This has enshrined in law both a 
target of net zero emissions by 2050 and 
measures for climate adaptation (improved 
resilience). It is complementary to NI-wide 
efforts to reduce emissions and improve 
the resilience of our communities and urban 
spaces. Crucially, this includes the Green 
Growth Strategy and the Northern Ireland 
Climate Change Adaptation Programme 
(2019). It also covers the landscape of 
policies set out by government and advice 
from the UK Committee on Climate Change 
and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC). 
The UK Climate Change Act (amended 2019) 
has enshrined in law a UK-wide target of net 
zero emissions by 2050 and measures for 
climate adaptation. Factoring climate action  
into everything we do 
We must transition to a net zero carbon 
economy quickly, but in the right way – 
making sure it is a just transition ensuring 
the benefits of a green economy transition 
are shared widely, while also supporting 
those who stand to lose economically, 
improving the environment whilst creating 
jobs and prosperity for the area. 
T o make sure we are doing all we can to reach our goals, we commit to  
the following principles that will guide our approach to climate action: 
Working with our stakeholders and partners 
and listening to their ideas, experiences, and 
views. 
Ensuring that vulnerable groups  who are 
most likely to be impacted by climate change 
are prioritised in our decision-making. 
Identifying measurable targets  to track 
performance against our goals. 
Keeping  our actions and targets in line with  
changing legislation  and recommendations.Accessing the best possible evidence  
of our impact so we can learn, share our 
experience and hone our actions as we go. 
Embedding a climate lens  into all our  
decision-making. 
Monitoring  progress against our targets  
at regular intervals. 
Reporting  publicly through Council, 
Committees and via published annual 
reports. 
Reviewing  and refreshing  the action plan 
every three years.

Our evidence base
As a Council, we have begun to build an evidence base upon which we have 
designed our action plan. We have set long-term targets that are compatible  
with the Paris Agreement and we will seek to increase the evidence base available 
for decision making and target setting when this Plan is updated in three years.  
We have identified separate targets for the Council, the District, and in time we 
will develop targets for different types of emissions to ensure we deliver as much 
as possible, as soon as possible. 
We have identified  
separate targets for the  
Council and the District  
in line with the  
Paris AgreementWe bought 6 new electric 
vehicles in 2012 and have  
also installed 9 new electric 
vehicle charging points on  
the Council’s Estate.
The number of trees planted 
on Council estate has 
increased significantly from 
36 in 2017/18, to 1,600 in 
2018/19 to 5,200 in 2019/20.
The % of Council buildings 
with Display Energy 
Certificate ratings ‘C’ or better 
has increased from 32% in 
2015/16 to 65.5% in 2019/20.
We have committed to 
renovating 3% of our building 
stock’s heated floor area 
per year to improve energy 
efficiency standards. Supporting the achievement of net zero
We are aiming to achieve 
100% increase in on-site 
renewable energy generation 
(kWh) by 2025 compared to 
the 2017/18 baseline.
We have committed to 
ensuring that 100% of all  
new Council staff will be given 
training on energy-awareness 
as part of their induction.
Between October and 
December 2020, we generated 
the lowest waste arisings 
of all Councils in Northern 
Ireland at 14,844 tonnes and 
consistently generate the 2nd 
lowest amount of waste per 
population and per household.14How we remove carbon  
from the atmosphere
We look after approximately 112 hectares 
of green spaces across the District. This 
roughly equates to approximately 140 
football pitches. This natural capital not only 
provides valued space for people and nature 
but also currently removes 400 tonnes of 
CO 2 per year, based on average benchmarks 
for carbon sequestration from municipal 
green space. This is equivalent to 13% of the 
Council’s scope 1 and 2 emissions.
112 hectares of green spaces across 
Fermanagh and Omagh are managed  
by the Council.Council emissions  
(scope 1, 2 emissions) 2019/20
4,175 tonnes of CO 2
We need to reduce or remove at least 4,175 tonnes of CO 2 to support the Council’s 
overarching goal of net zero. Scope 3 emissions – which cover everything the Council buys, 
sells, invests in, leases to others, and disposes of as well as commuting and business travel -  
will be added to this baseline when the data becomes available.

Under the latest set of projected changes 
in climate for Northern Ireland (UK Climate 
Projections 2018) we are going to experience 
warmer wetter winters, hotter drier summers, 
more extreme weather events, such as 
heatwaves and intense storms. 
The main risk in Fermanagh and Omagh 
is more frequent and intense episodes of 
flooding in winter, which will cause damage 
and disruption to businesses, communities, 
infrastructure, agriculture and the natural 
environment, health, water supply and  
daily life.

Funding  
Although the Council is not a direct funder, 
we can scan for funding opportunities for 
the District to help achieve our goals. We will 
also explore the possibility of raising funds, to 
support low-carbon investment in our estate 
and projects and services that may benefit rate 
payers. 
Influencing and Co-Design  
We know that when we use our expertise and 
experience to co-design or be part of a larger 
initiative, we are likely to have significant 
influence. This might be in setting more 
ambitious outcomes in our Community Plan  
or holding a strong line on our mission on 
regional working groups or advisory panels.
Research and Evidence  
We have seen that where we work with other 
experts and practitioners in commissioning 
research and evidence, the ripple effects are 
much greater than if we do so alone. We do not 
always have to lead on these initiatives but are 
involved in their core design and development 
(see above).Intermediaries  
We will support key organisations or 
intermediaries who support collaboration 
on climate and sustainability issues. These 
best practice forums help develop strategic 
partnerships, amplifying the collective voice 
around climate change. 
Convening   
Through Community Planning, we convene  
and connect networks of organisations to meet 
regularly to foster dialogue, share learning, 
create joint opportunities and develop new, 
collective approaches. The Partnership brings 
together corporate, public and voluntary sectors 
to work better together to deliver collective 
change. We will use this to support delivery 
of our new Climate Change and Sustainable 
Development Strategy and Action Plan.Environmental, Social and Governance  
(ESG) Investing  
We would like to use our role as an investor 
to support our sustainable development 
goals. Working with our investment manager, 
NILGOSC, we will ask for a transition of our 
pension portfolio towards ESG factors, and to 
avoid investing in new funds that are directly 
in conflict with our climate and sustainable 
development goals.
Communication and Learning  
We will build a reputation for sharing insights 
and challenges from our work and ensure that 
what we learn influences our strategic decisions. 
We will also work to ensure that what we ask 
from our partners and suppliers is proportionate 
and useful.We have identified key actions which we believe can best contribute to the achievement 
of the outcomes identified in our Strategy, using existing ‘tools in the box’.
29Monitoring  
& Reporting
30
We will keep on track by consistently checking on progress –  
‘are we there yet’?  What do we need to change?
Through biannual performance reporting, we will be able to check  
progress against our climate and sustainability objectives and refine  
delivery where necessary to achieve our objectives. We will review  
and update the plan after three years and in that period, further  
develop our evidence base to support action planning and prioritisation  
of resources.Glossary
Carbon removal  is the process by which a carbon 
sink, such as forestry, reduces the amount of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Climate resilience  is the ability to anticipate, 
prepare for and respond to hazardous events, 
trends or disturbances related to climate  
(Centre for Climate and Energy Solutions).
Greenhouse gases  are the emissions responsible 
for global warming. These include carbon dioxide, 
methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases 
amongst others.
A Just Transition  means ensuring the benefits 
of a green economy transition are shared widely, 
while also supporting those who stand to lose 
economically – be they countries, regions, 
industries, communities, workers or consumers.
KtCO 2 means Kilotonnes of carbon dioxide  
and is a standard unit of measurement for  
carbon emissions.
A low-carbon economy  is an economy that causes 
low levels of GHG emissions compared with today’s 
carbon-intensive economy. ‘Carbon’ refers to 
carbon dioxide, the GHG which contributes the 
most to climate change. The low-carbon economy 
can be seen as a step in the process towards a 
zero-carbon economy. (Science Direct)Natural capital  refers to the stock of natural 
resources, which includes geology, soils, air, water 
and all living organisms.
Net zero  is achieved when anthropogenic 
emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere 
are balanced by anthropogenic removals over 
a specified period (definition by Science Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi) and CDP.
Science-based / Paris-aligned  GHG emissions 
reduction targets are considered “science-based”  
if they are in line with what the latest climate 
science says is necessary to meet the goals of the 
Paris Agreement (2015) - to limit global warming 
to well- below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and 
pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C.
Scopes 1, 2 and 3 for an organisation:  (based on 
Defra Environmental Reporting Guidelines and the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol, A Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard, revised edition)
Scope 1  (direct) means emissions from activities 
owned or controlled by your organisation that 
release emissions into the atmosphere. They are 
direct emissions. Examples of scope 1 emissions 
include emissions from combustion in owned or 
controlled boilers, furnaces, vehicles, emissions 
from chemical production in owned or controlled 
process equipment.Scope 2  (energy indirect) means emissions 
released into the atmosphere associated with your 
consumption of purchased electricity, heat, steam 
and cooling. These are indirect emissions that are a 
consequence of your organisation’s activities, but 
which occur at sources you do not own or control.
Scope 3  (other indirect) means emissions that are 
a consequence of your actions, which occur at 
sources which you do not own or control and which 
are not classed as scope 2 emissions. Examples of 
scope 3 emissions are business travel by means not 
owned or controlled by your organisation, waste 
disposal which is not owned or controlled,  
or purchased materials.
Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs) are vehicles 
that are reported to emit less than 75g of carbon 
dioxide (CO 2) from the tailpipe for every kilometre 
travelled. In practice, the term typically refers to 
battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric and fuel cell 
electric vehicles. 
Zero waste / circular economy  means keeping 
resources in use for as long as possible, extracting 
the maximum value from them whilst in use, then 
recovering and regenerating products and materials 
at the end of each service life.
