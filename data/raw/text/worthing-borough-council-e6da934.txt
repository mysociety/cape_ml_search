  Executive Summary 
Background and Context 
On July 9th 2019, the Joint Strategic Committee of Adur  & Worthing Councils declared a Climate 
Emergency, and committed to working towards becoming carbon neutral by 2030.   
As part of this commitment, the Councils resolved to develop a science- and evidence-based Carbon 
Neutral Plan that would identify the key action s and intervention measures required to set the 
Councils on the path to net zero carbon emissions. This work is intended to provide the Councils with an understanding of their own carbon emissions base line and identify the steps that need to be taken 
to achieve the decarbonisation target by 2030.  
Recommendations have been informed by carbon proj ections modelling, detailed energy audits, and 
stakeholder engagement workshops, to ensure that the Plan reflects  the unique circumstances and 
priorities of Adur & Worthing Councils as they look towards the future. 
This Plan is aligned to the Councils’ strategic vision Platforms for our Places  under Platform 3: 
Tackling Climate Change and Supporting our Natural Environment ; and SustainableAW , the Councils’ 
shared framework for sustainability. It also contribu tes to delivery against the Councils’ UK100 Cities 
pledge to achieve 100% clean energy by 2050 across Adur & Worthing. 
Establishing a baseline 
In line with the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) ‘ Emissions Reduction 
Pledge 2020’  guidance,1 for the purpose of greenhouse gas re porting, emissions are divided into 
three categories, referred to as Scope 1, 2 and 3. T he table below provides a definition of these terms 
and summarises the data used in establishing Adur & Worthing Councils’ baseline CO 2e emissions. 
Category Description Data used in this analysis 
Scope 1 Direct emissions from 
sources owned or controlled by the reporting organisation  Metered gas data (for buildings where the Councils pay 
the gas bills) 
Mileage for Council-owned vehicle fleet and pool cars, 
along with vehicle make/model and age 
Scope 2 Indirect emissions from the 
generation of energy purchased by the reporting organisation Metered electricity data (for buildings where the Councils 
pay the electricity bills) 
Note that, where data was unavailable, industry standard 
benchmarks were used to estimate fuel consumption 
Scope 3 Indirect emissions that result 
from other activities that occur in the value chain of the reporting organisation, either upstream or downstream. Metered water use data 
Records of business travel by the Councils’ employees 
(cost data provided; mileage estimated from £/mi) 
 
Based on this information – gas, electricity, and v ehicle use in the year from April 2018-March 2019 – 
we estimate that the current annual Scope 1 and 2 emissions are approximately 2,908 tCO 2e per 
annum (p.a.). Scope 3 emissions from water consum ption and business travel in non-Council owned 
vehicles (i.e. car mileage logged via essential or  casual car user payments) each amount to 
approximately 33 tCO 2e p.a., or 66 tCO 2e p.a. in total. Scope 3 emissions from the Worthing Leisure 
Centre and Splashpoint (based on 2014/15 fuel consumption) accounts for a further 1,015 tCO 2e p.a.

  Note that there are additional Scope 3 emissions, such  as those arising from business travel by public 
transport, car mileage not logged via essential or cas ual car user payments,  emissions from waste or 
emissions from procurement that have not been quantified in this report due to insufficient data. In the 
future, Adur & Worthing Councils could consider a variety of additional data collection methods that 
could provide further visibility of these emissions. 
Figures 1 and 2 below illustrate the relative contribu tion from different fuels, building use categories, 
external use categories (i.e. external lighting and CCTV) and vehicle types. (Not e: emissions from the 
Leisure Centre and Splashpoint were estimated us ing 2014-15 data, which was the most complete 
information available.)

Results show that gas and electricity use in bu ildings accounts for the majority of Scope 1 and 2 
emissions (42% and 28%, respectively). The next bigge st contributor is fuel use for HGVs (26%), 
while other vehicles such as cars and diesel vans make up around 5%. The crematorium also represents a significant source of 
CO 2e emissions, primarily due to the gas used for heat.  
Based on available data going back to 2011/12, the Councils’ Scope 1 and 2 emissions have 
decreased by approximately 20% overall and 23% si nce 2013/14. It is important to note that the 
annual emissions vary significantly over time, due to a variety of factors not assessed in detail in this 
report. These include factors such as weather and us er behaviour, but a key sensitivity is linked to 
changes in the Councils’ ownership or operation of buildings or provision of services. This report only 
considers properties both owned and operated by the Councils where they pay for the electricity and 
gas. As an example of the potential scale of impa ct this would have, if the Councils owned and 
operated the Worthing Leisure Centre and Splashpoin t, their Scope 1 and 2 emissions would increase 
by around 32%. 
Routes to 2030 
Carbon projection modelling has been carried out to a ssess the potential impact of a range of future 
trends that are expected to affect the Councils’ emi ssions. This includes interventions that would be 
led by the Councils (e.g. switching to 100% electric  vehicles), but also accounts for broader changes 
expected to take place on a primarily national leve l (e.g. decarbonisation of the national electricity 
grid). Other factors considered in clude energy demand reduction in existing buildings, switching from 
the use of gas-fired heating to electric systems, such as heat pumps, and reducing journey mileage, 
for instance, by planning vehicle routes differently , or taking measures to promote a shift towards 
walking, cycling, ridesharing and public transport. 
It is important to note that these scenarios are not intended to predict actual fuel consumption or CO 2e 
emissions. Instead, they used to highlight key issues and suppo rt the identification of carbon 
reduction interventions to inform the actions and re commendations laid out in subsequent chapters of 
this Carbon Neutral Plan. 
The cumulative impacts of these intervention measures are summarised in Figure 3 below.  Electricity, 28%

Note that ‘Offsetting’ could comprise a variety of measures, including investment in renewables (on or 
offsite) or carbon sequestration through land man agement (e.g. tree planting and woodland creation). 
This analysis indicates that the mo st significant carbon reductions will result from switching towards 
the use of electric heating sy stems and electric vehicles – provided that the national electricity grid 
undergoes significant decarbonisation .  
Demand reduction measures (energy efficiency and behavioural change in buildings, and reduced 
use of transportation) have less impact when cons idered on their own but are crucial prerequisites for 
successfully switching switch to wards the use of electric heating and vehicles. For instance, energy 
efficiency improvements in buildings enable systems such as heat pumps to work at a higher level of 
efficiency. Similarly, a large-scale shift to the us e of electric vehicles must be accompanied by a 
significant modal shift towards walking, cycling,  ridesharing, and an increase in the use of public 
transport.  
As buildings and vehicles switch away from the use of fossil fuels and towards electricity, it becomes 
increasingly important to ensure that electricity is supplied from renewable sources. This is important 
for several reasons, including reducing pressure on grid infrastructure, ensuring security of supply, and protecting consumers from rising electricity prices.  
On the other hand, shifting towards the use of elec tricity means that the route towards becoming zero 
carbon increasingly depends on national grid decar bonisation. This leads to significant uncertainty 
when projecting carbon emissions and serves to reinforce the message that demand reduction and 
renewable energy generation should be high priorities for Adur & Worthing Councils. 
The scenario testing demonstrated that, even with the most optimistic assessment of grid and 
transport decarbonisation and rapid uptake for energy  efficiency measures, there will be significant 
residual 
CO 2e emissions that would require offsetting. Further work and consultation would be 
required to identify the most approp riate and cost-effective opportunit ies, but these could include: 
 Investing in off-site renewable electricity generation. Note that, at present, the Councils 
purchase electricity that is 100% matched by wi nd and hydroelectric installations. Additional 
commitments would be required to offset  emissions from all other fuel types. 
 
 Carbon sequestration through land management, woodland creation, and tree planting. For 
context, as a rough estimate, offsetting the Council’s current CO 2e emissions would require 0500,0001,000,0001,500,0002,000,0002,500,0003,000,0003,500,0004,000,0004,500,000

  conversion of around 800 hectares (almost 8 square kilometres) of low-grade agricultural land 
to sustainably managed woodland.2 Offsetting the residual emissions after all measures are 
adopted (as shown in Figure 3 and assuming su bstantial grid decarbonisation) would still 
require around 460 hectares (4.6 square kilometr es) of new woodland. As this is clearly not 
feasible, it shows the importance of mitigating emissions as far as possible, with this option 
used to address only the last remaining residual emissions.   
Specific intervention opportunities 
In order to identify specific opportunities for demand reduction measures in the Councils’ own 
buildings, AECOM carried out building energy audits on a range of properties owned and operated by Adur & Worthing Councils.  
The table below summarises the results of these audits, listing the potential intervention areas that 
could be considered, along with an estimate of the carbon savings that could be achieved. These 
estimates account for the energy efficiency improvement  measures in addition to national electricity 
grid decarbonisation.

  Table 1. Results of building energy audits 
Cells highlighted in green indicate that a measure is  considered suitable for the specific building listed. 
 
In total, the above measures could potentially save up to 749 tCO 2e per annum (Scope 1 and 2 only), which is equivalent to roughly one quarter of the 2018/19 
baseline. (However, note that not all of the buildings listed above are included within the Councils’ Scope 1 and 2 baseline.) Broadly speaking, roof-mounted PV could 
also be installed on unshaded roofs of su itable orientation. Further reductions c ould potentially be achieved by introducing a district heat network within the Councils’ 
Civic Quarter. This report provides an overview of the practi calities that would be involved in such a project, along with a di scussion of the potentially significant benefits.

  Priority areas and action plan 
This work highlights that there is considerable uncerta inty in the trajectory to 2030, and that that there 
will be significant challenges in reducing e nergy demands and offs etting any remaining CO 2e 
emissions. Adur & Worthing Councils will need to actively work towards enabling the following: 
 In buildings , it will be necessary to reduce heat and power demands through fabric 
efficiency improvements and behavioural chang e. In addition to investing in the 
existing building stock, this means ensuring that any future development achieves a 
high standard of energy efficiency in order to minimise any increase in fuel consumption. Long term, all buildings will need to switch from gas / fossil fuels to low and zero carbon heat sources. 
 Uptake of low and zero carbon (LZC) technologies and battery storage within the 
Councils’ own stock will reduce  reliance on fossil fuels, re duce pressure on existing 
utility infrastructure, improve se curity of supply, and mitigate against price fluctuations.  
 A transformation in the  transport sector must take place, which would replace all 
existing vehicles with low and zero emission vehicles. In addition, it will be necessary to reduce vehicle use / mileage thro ugh behavioural change and modal shift.  
 A key challenge for Adur & Worthing Coun cils is the fact that much of the emissions 
from vehicles are due to HGVs , and due to technological factors, it is less certain 
that zero emission models will become commer cially available by 2030. This suggests 
that careful route planning and other marg inal efficiency improvements should be 
introduced to reduce HGV mileage as much as possible.  
 In order to offset any remaining CO
2e emissions , the Councils will need to explore 
additional measures, such as promoting carbon sequestration through sustainable woodland management or investing in large- scale renewable energy generation. It is 
important to note, however, that carbon of fsetting is not enough to achieve the net 
zero target on its own – success relies on maximising demand reduction and renewable electricity generation as a high priority. 
 
The detailed recommendations from the study are set out in an action plan which aims to support the 
Councils in delivering the intervention measures re quired to realise their carbon neutral ambition. The 
recommendations cover the following areas: General actions; Supporting grid decarbonisation; Demand reduction; Low carbon heat ing systems; Building integrat ed renewable energy generation 
and storage; Low carbon transport; Offsetting; and Sc ope 3 emissions. Consideration is given to 
measures that would directly impact 
CO 2e emissions from the Councils’ own operations, as well as 
those that the Councils could indi rectly influence, such as energy  efficiency in leased or rented 
properties. 
Conclusion  
The results of this analysis show that the route towards becoming carbon neutral will require a strong level of ambition and commitment, backed up by signif icant interventions and in vestment across Adur 
& Worthing Councils’ operations. Al though the study shows that meet ing the carbon neutral ambition 
will rely upon various factors outside of the Councils’ control, such as the deca rbonisation of the grid 
and availability of key technologies, the fundamental st eps required to deliver the net-zero target are 
clear and, with strong leadership from the Co uncils, these can be set into action now. 
  
Adur & Worthing Councils – Carbon Neutral Plan    AECOM 
 
 
  
Prepared for:  Adur & Worthing Councils 8 
  1. Introduction and context 
1.1 Adur & Worthing’s C limate Emergency Declaration 
On July 9th 2019, the Joint Strategic Committee of A dur & Worthing Councils (AWC) declared a 
Climate Emergency, and committed to working towards becoming carbon neutral by 2030.   
As part of this commitment, the Councils resolved to develop a science- and evidence-based Carbon 
Neutral Plan that would identify the key action s and intervention measures required to set the 
Councils on the path to net zero carbon emissions within the next decade.  
1.2 Purpose of this study 
AECOM has been commissioned to support Adur & Worthing Councils in producing this Carbon Neutral Plan. This work is intended to provide the Councils with an understanding of their carbon 
emissions baseline and identify the steps that need to be taken to achieve the decarbonisation target.  
The recommendations in this Carbon Neutral Plan have been informed by carbon emissions 
modelling that accounts for key technological trend s and policy changes that are expected to take 
place at national, regional and local levels over t he coming decades. It also draws on detailed energy 
audits of the Councils’ own building stock.  Proposed actions have been developed through 
engagement with local stakeholders, to ensure that the Plan reflects the unique circumstances and 
priorities of Adur & Worthing Councils as they look towards the future. 
1.3 Drivers for achieving Net Zero Emissions 
A selection of targets, policies and initiatives aimed at reducing CO 2e emissions are described below. 
particularly those related to decarbonising heat, energy and transportation in Adur & Worthing.  
Although it is not possible to fully  capture the wide range of environmental, social, and economic 
drivers for taking action to address the threat of climate change, these are some of the key drivers 
that have been used to inform the analysis that underpin this Carbon Neutral Plan.  
National 
UK Climate Change Act 2008 
The UK Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019  legally commits the UK 
Government to reducing emissions by 100% by  the year 2050, compared with a 1990 baseline.3 As 
described by the UK Committ ee on Climate Change (CCC), ‘The Act provides the UK with a legal 
framework including a 2050 target for emissions r eductions, five-yearly ‘carbon budgets’ (limits on 
emissions over a set time period which act as stepping stones towards the 2050 target), and the 
development of a climate change adaptation plan.’4 The CCC is an independent statutory body which 
sets the magnitude of carbon budgets; the Governme nt must prepare policies accordingly.    
The Paris Climate Agreement 
The UK ratified the Paris Climate Agreement in  November 2016. The Agreement’s central aim ‘is to 
strengthen the global response to the threat of c limate change by keeping a global temperature rise 
this century well below 2º Celsius above pre-indu strial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the 
temperature increase even further to 1.5º Celsius.’5  
                                                                                                           
3 The original (2008) target of 80% was amended through subsequent legislation in 2019. See  ‘The Climate Change Act 2008 
(2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019’ : http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/1056/contents/made

  Building Regulations (Part L) 
Part L of Building Regulations is the key mechanism that prescribes standards for the conservation of 
fuel and power in buildings in the UK, based on me trics such as the estimated level of energy demand 
and CO 2e emissions. At the time of writing, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local 
Government (MHCLG) has recently released a consultation on proposed Future Homes Standards, 
that would significantly reduce emissions from new domestic buildings in the UK.6  
 
Note that future versions of Part L are expected to  adopt carbon emission factors for grid electricity 
that are significantly lower7 than those used in Part L 2013. This change would make it easier to 
achieve the required level of CO 2 savings using electric heating systems, and especially heat pumps, 
while making it harder to achieve using gas boilers.    
The Clean Growth Strategy (2017) 
The UK Clean Growth Strategy8 was published in October 2017 and sets out the Government’s vision 
for decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions. It includes objectives for increasing generation of energy from renewable sources, increa sing the delivery of clean, smart and flexible 
power and accelerating the shift to low carbon transport, smart grids and energy storage.  
The Road to Zero (2018) 
The Road to Zero report,
9 published in July 2018, sets out the Government’s core mission to ‘ put the 
UK at the forefront of the design and manufacturing of zero emissions vehicles and for all new cars 
and vans to effectively be zero emission by 2040.’  The strategy furthers the ambitions of the NO 2 
plan10 and Clean Growth Strategy in defining key policies with primary focus upon introduction of low 
and zero emission vehicles, with the aim that ‘at least 50%, and as many as 70%, of new car sales 
and up to 40% new van sales being ultra low emission by 2030. By 2050 we want almost every car 
and van to be zero emission.’  
The Government has stated that local action will be supported through new policies, including 
provision of funding to extend ultr a low emission bus schemes and taxi charging infrastructure. Goals 
aimed at encouraging uptake of new ultra lo w emission vehicles (ULEVs) will be backed by 
developing electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure, and offering funds and grants for provision of EV 
charging points. The Government also intends to su pport further research into zero emission vehicle

2025. This consultation sets out what we think a home built to the Future Homes Standard will be 
like. We expect that an average home built to it will have 75- 80% less carbon emissions than one 
built to current energy efficiency requirements (A pproved Document L 2013). We expect this will 
be achieved through very high fabric standards and a low carbon heating system. This means a new home built to the Future Homes Standard might have a heat pump, triple glazing and standards for walls, floors and roofs t hat significantly limit any heat loss.’

Regional 
South2East Local Energy Strategy (2018) 
The South2East Energy Strategy11 was developed by three Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs), 
which are joint private / public organisations intended to drive economic growth in a broad geographic area encompassing Adur & Worthing. The Strategy  outlines a vision for achieving clean growth 
through the year 2050, with a focus on the power, heat and transportation sectors.   
It highlights several key opportunities for the region, including: 
 Significant renewable energy potential, especially  solar, wind, energy from waste and landfill gas; 
 Rich natural assets (including a high proportion of woodland); and 
 Large amounts of planned new development within the region, offering opportunities for 
deployment of smart, integrated, su stainable energy system models.  
West Sussex County Council 
The West Sussex County Council has produced an Energy Strategy and Action Plan (covering the 
period 2016-2020) to address key issues relating to  energy in West Sussex, chief among which are 
security, affordability and sustainability. The document s provide a framework for the County Council to 
reduce energy demands and increase uptake of renewable technologies. 
West Sussex County Council is also in the proce ss of developing an Electric Vehicle Strategy (draft 
2019). This states the ambition to ensure that at l east 50% of all registered vehicles within the County 
are ultra low emission or electric (ULEV) by 2030, wi th an aspirational target of reaching 70% by that 
time. The Strategy further states that the West Sussex County Council will seek to ensure that 
sufficient charging infrastructure is installed to  enable this shift, and that all charging points are 
supplied with 100% renewable energy. 
SMARTHUBS – Smart Local Energy Systems (SLES) 
West Sussex County Council is one of the main part ners in Project SMARTHUBS.  This initiative will 
see Adur & Worthing Councils working in collaboration with private sector partners to deliver new smart, local energy systems in West Sussex, with a particular focus on the Adur and Worthing area.  
Some of the key aims of the project are to in crease the amount of renew able electricity generated 
using solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and use this in combination with battery storage to power both 
domestic and commercial heat pumps. Notably, this will include the development of a district heat 
network (DHN) in the Shoreham Port area, which w ould provide customers with low carbon source of 
energy for heating.  
Other SMARTHUBS projects will focu s on delivering sustainable transpor t in the area, by linking solar 
photovoltaic (PV) arrays and battery storage to new EV charging infrastructure and investigating 
opportunities to power vehicles using hydrogen gas.

Prepared for:  Adur & Worthing Councils 11 
  As part of this initiative, the Councils have made several commitments aimed at reducing emissions 
and shifting to clean energy across their estates. These include, but are not limited to: 
 Developing a detailed understanding of the Counc ils’ emissions, along with a strategy to save 
energy and reduce emissions;  
 Retrofitting built infrastructure to improve env ironmental efficiency across corporate buildings 
and social housing stock; and 
 Delivering further clean, renewable energy on Council buildings and sites, including a 
programme of solar photovoltaic (PV) installations. 
Platforms for Our Places – Going Further 2020-2022 
The new Platforms includes greater ambition on climate change following the Climate Emergency 
Declaration. Platform 3 has been renamed Tackling Climate Change and Supporting the Natural 
Environment in light of the heightened focus on climate change and carbon emissions reductions, and 
one of the new commitments below this includes greater focus on climate resilience.   
SustainableAW 2018-2019 
Building on the commitments made by Adur & Worthing Councils as part of Platforms for our Places, 
Sustainable AW is an initiative designed to addres s a wide range of environmental issues. These 
include biodiversity, carbon reduction, ener gy, transport, waste reduction and water.  
SustainableAW 2020-2023 
The refreshed SustainableAW introduces greater ambition, 
four additional areas of action, and proposes deeper engagement and collaboration with the local community and stakeholders. Thus, it provides a framework to address the crisis in natural ecosystems and the 
Climate Emergency declared by members at the Joint Strategic Committee on 9
th July 2019. 
SustainableAW 2020-2023  reflects and highlights Platform 3 commitments but includes a new layer of 
action that will be sought from community and businesses.  
As part of these programmes, and reflecting a broade r commitment to sustainability, Adur & Worthing 
Councils have already taken steps to reduce thei r environmental impact, including but not limited to: 
 Sourcing renewable energy thr ough their electricity contract; 
 PV installations on Portland House and Shoreham Centre; 
 Ground-source heating at  the crematorium; and 
 Ongoing LED lighting replacement across the estate.

   Units for greenhouse gas emissions reporting: CO2e 
A carbon footprint is measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e). The carbon 
dioxide equivalent (CO 2e) allows the different greenhouse gases to be compared on a like-for-like 
basis relative to one unit of CO 2. CO 2e is calculated by multiplying the emissions of each of the 
six greenhouse gases by its 100 year global warming potential (GWP). 
A carbon footprint considers all six of the Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gases:  
Carbon dioxide (CO 2), Methane (CH 4), Nitrous oxide (N 2O), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 
Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) a nd Sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6).

  2. Where we are: The carbon emissions baseline 
2.1 Scope of the analysis 
For the purpose of greenhouse gas reporting, emissions are divided into three categories: 
 Scope 1  – Direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by AWC. This primarily 
includes fuel used in boilers to provide heati ng and hot water and fuel used in vehicles. This is 
limited to buildings and vehicles where the Counc ils are responsible for paying the fuel bills.  
 Scope 2  – Indirect emissions associated with the use of electricity purchased by AWC. 
 Scope 3  – Indirect emissions that result from other activities that occur in the value chain of 
AWC, either upstream or downstream. This incl udes emissions associated with buildings and 
services linked to the Councils but where they ar e not responsible for paying the fuel bills, for 
example leased properties, the leisure cent res and the waste management system. It also 
includes business travel using non-Council owned vehicles. 
The baseline for the Council’s emissions include Sc ope 1, 2 and some Scope 3 emissions. In the 
future, additional data collection could be undertaken to better understand the Councils’ Scope 3 emissions. These would include,  for instance, emissions from waste disposal, and procurement.  
2.2 Carbon emissions in 2018/19 
Based on metered gas and electricity consumption and recorded vehicle use, we estimate that the 
annual Scope 1 and 2 emissions were approximately 2,908 tCO 2e in the year from April 2018-March 
2019. Scope 3 emissions from water consumption and business travel each amount to approximately 
33 tCO 2e p.a. and emissions from the Worthing Leisure Centre and Splashpoint13 account for a 
further 1,015 tCO 2e p.a. Table 1 presents a breakdown of the Councils’ emissions by category and 
fuel type, and the results are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. (‘External’ refers to both external lighting 
and CCTV.)

Figure 2: Scope 1 and 2 CO 2e emissions by fuel type (2018/19) 
Results show that gas and electricity use in bu ildings accounts for the majority of Scope 1 and 2

Other vehicles such as cars and diesel vans make up for around 5%. The crematorium also represents a major source of 
CO 2e emissions, primarily due to the gas used for heat.  
Based on available data going back to 2011/12, the Councils’ Scope 1 and 2 emissions have 
decreased by approximately 20% overall and 23% si nce 2013/14. It is important to note that the  - 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200

  annual Scope 1 and 2 emissions vary significantly over  time, partly as a result of the decarbonisation 
of electricity supplied by the national grid but also due to a variety of factors not assessed in detail in 
this report. These include factors such as weather a nd user behaviour, but a key sensitivity is linked to 
changes in the Councils’ ownership or operation of buildings or provision of services. As an example 
of the potential scale of impact th is would have, if the Councils owned and operated the Worthing 
Leisure Centre and Splashpoint, their Scope 1 and 2 emissions would increase by around 36%.  
2.3 Implications for the Carbon Neutral Plan 
Considering the breakdown of Adur & Worthing Councils’ current CO 2e emissions, the Carbon Neutral 
Plan will need to include targeted intervention measur es that contribute towards the following goals:  
 
Reduce electricity demands 
and use renewable electricity  
Reduce heating demands 
and phase out natural gas 
  
 
Switch to ULEV cars / vans 
and reduce demand for transport  
  
Investigate options for 
reducing HGV emissions 
 
 
 
 
Seek to understand and reduce 
Scope 3 emissions  
 
The 2018/19 baseline essentially provides a ‘snapshot’ vi ew of priorities for Adur & Worthing Councils.  
Therefore, in order to gain a better understanding  of the potential changes over time, high-level 
modelling has been carried out to project carbon emissions to 2030. The aim is to show the relative scale and direction of changes t hat could affect the Councils’ 
CO 2e emissions in the years ahead and 
show a range of potential routes toward s achieving the decarbonisation target. Adur & Worthing Councils – Carbon Neutral Plan    AECOM

  3. Routes to Net Zero: Projections to 2030 
3.1 Modelling approach 
The analysis presented in this report considers inte rventions that would be led by the Councils (e.g. 
switching to 100% electric vehicles), but also ac counts for wider trends (e.g. decarbonisation of the 
national electricity grid). Key assumptions are outlin ed below. The methodology is described in detail 
in Appendix A.  
 National electricity grid decarbonisation  – The emission factor for grid electricity is expected to 
continue to decrease over time, as it will be generated using less fossil fuel and more renewable 
energy. This analysis considers the impact of a gr id decarbonisation trajectory published by BEIS 
for use in organisational CO 2e emissions reporting and projections,  which is illustrated in Figure 
3.14 Although not a prediction, the trajectory reflects the ambitions set by the Government and 
seen as necessary to meet the UK’s carbon emission reduction commitments. 
 
Figure 3: Historic and Long-run marginal grid decarbonisation 
 Energy demand reduction  through energy efficiency measures and behaviour change – Based 
on statistics provided in the UK Nati onal Energy Efficiency Database (NEED)15 we have assumed 
that fabric upgrades could reduce demand for heating by around 10%, and that electricity use 
could decrease by around 5% through a combinat ion of behavioural change measures and smart 
energy management. 
 Switching from the use of gas-fi red heating to electric systems  – Based on metered gas 
data, and accounting for differences in the typica l performance of gas boilers, direct electric 
heating, and heat pumps, we have estimated the change in fuel use if the total 2018/19 heating 
requirements were met by these alternative heating technologies. 
 Reducing demand for transport –  Based on case studies of mileage reduction in similar 
organisations, we have assumed that a 10% reduct ion in mileage could be achieved, for instance, 
by using smart route planning, or taking measures  to promote a shift towards walking, cycling,

  ridesharing and public transport.16 Due to technological obstacles, we have assumed that HGV 
emissions reductions will be capped at 15%. 
 Uptake of Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs)  in the Councils’ vehicle fleet and pool cars – 
In line with assumptions made by the Department for Transport’s ‘Road to Zero’  (2018) report, we 
have assumed that ULEV upt ake will increase rapidly in the coming decade and therefore aside 
from HGVs, all vehicles operated by AWC coul d be ultra-low emission (powered either by 
hydrogen or electricity) by 2030. 
The model assumes that, in a hypothetical ‘No Action’  or ‘Business as Usual’ scenario, no actions are 
taken to reduce emissions, there is no change to the Councils’ building portfolio or vehicle fleet, fuel consumption remains steady, and total CO
2e emissions do not change over time.17 This is used as a 
baseline for assessing the cumulative impacts of the intervention measures. 
It is important to note that these scenarios are not intended to predict actual fuel consumption 
or CO 2e emissions. Instead, the analysis highlights priority measures for reducing emissions, which 
in turn informs the actions and recommendations laid out in Section 4.  
3.2 Carbon emissions projections 
The graphs below show historic emissions for the Councils, along with a hypothetical ‘Business as 
Usual’ trajectory. The other routes to net zero show the cumulative impact of sequentially adopting 
measures to: 
1. Reduce energy demands in buildings; 
2. Switch from gas boilers to efficient electric heating systems; 3. Reduce vehicle mileage; 4. Switch from petrol and diesel vehicles to UL EV (electric or hydrogen) vehicles; and finally  
5. Offset residual CO
2e emissions to reach the net zero tar get. Note that this trajectory is 
purely illustrative and is intended to provide an estimate of the amount of low and zero carbon (LZC) electricity generation or carbon offsetting that would be required.

17 In reality CO 2e emissions depend on many variables, including economic  trends, energy prices, and weather, to name only a 
few. For example, see National Grid ‘Future Energy Scenarios’  (2019). Available at: http://fes.nationalgrid.com/fes-document/  Adur & Worthing Councils – Carbon Neutral Plan    AECOM

  Figure 4 shows the potential CO 2e reductions that could be achieved assuming that there is no change 
in the national electricity grid. In this scenario, if all measures (e xcluding renewables and offsetting) 
are adopted, this would reduce Scope 1 and 2 emis sions by 30% by 2030. The residual emissions 
(2,032 tCO 2e p.a.) would need to be made up for through r enewable electricity generation and carbon 
offsetting. For context, th is would require around: 
 17 MW of ground-mounted PV (i.e. solar farm s totalling around 85-90 acres of land); or 
 6 MW of large-scale onshore wind (3-6 large turbines); or 
 Approximately 575 hectares (5.8 square kilometres) of new woodland. 
By contrast, Figure 5 shows what would happe n using the same assumptions, assuming the 
electricity grid decarbonises at the rate  suggested by the BEIS Green Book Guidance. 
In this scenario, if all measures (excluding rene wables and offsetting) are adopted, this would reduce 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 44% by 2 030. The residual emissions (1,634 tCO 2e p.a.) would need to 
be made up for through renewable electricity generation and carbon offsetting.  
However, because the CO 2e savings from renewable technologies are measured by the amount of 
grid electricity that they displace , as the grid decarbonises, more LZC energy generation is needed to 
offset the same amount of CO 2e emissions.  (This issue does not apply to woodland creation, which 
will sequester the same amount of CO 2 independent of the electricity grid). Therefore, based on BEIS 
carbon emission factors (CEFs) for grid electricit y in 2030 (see Figure 3), offsetting this amount of 
CO 2e would require:  
 24 MW of ground-mounted PV (up to 120 acres of solar farm); or 
 9 MW of large-scale onshore wind (4-9 large turbines); or 
 Approximately 460 hectares of new woodland (4.6 square kilometers) – note that 
sequestration rates do not depend on grid em ission factors as the mechanism for CO 2e 
reduction is different. 
In reality, there is significant uncertainty regarding the level of CO 2e saving measures that can be 
implemented in the given timeframe, in which case  offsetting the Councils’ emissions would require 
even more investment in LZCs and woodland creation than cited above.  
This emphasises the fact that grid decarboni sation and offsetting will not be enough for Adur & 
Worthing to achieve their 2030 target – it must be supported by strong actions to reduce demand for 
fuel in buildings and transportation and eliminate the use of fossil fuels. 
Impact of grid decarbonisation 
A comparison of these results shows that grid deca rbonisation is one of the most important variables 
that will determine whether the Councils are able to meet the net  zero target. This has both positive 
and negative implications. On one hand, if the BE IS decarbonisation scenario were to occur, the 
Councils’ Scope 1 and 2 emissions could decrease by up to 14% even if no other actions were taken.  
On the other hand, this presents a key risk, becaus e it means that much of the reliance on achieving 
the net zero target will rely on factor s outside of the Councils’ control.  
To address and mitigat e this risk, consideration must be given to how the Co uncils can be st facilitate 
the government’s objectives in decarbonising the grid as well as what measures they can take to best 
insulate itself from the eventuality that grid de carbonisation does not happen as quickly and / or as 
deeply as the Government intends. 18 
                                                                                                           
18 Although there has been significant progress in this area in re cent years, future decarbonisa tion is anticipated to be much 
more difficult to achieve. To date, t he decarbonisation of the national grid has been primarily achieved through the significan t 
reduction in the use of coal fired power stations and the incr ease in the use of renewable te chnologies, particularly large-sca le 
wind and biomass (where it is used for co-firing in power stati ons). However, the use of gas remains a significant component of  
the generation mix and the timely replacement of the existing nuclear fleet  is already proving to be challenging. Furthermore, 
significant additional pressures from the use of electricity to provide heating and po wer vehicles may inc entivise firm power 
generation from fossil fuel sources to deal with greater peaks in demand. Adur & Worthing Councils – Carbon Neutral Plan    AECOM

  Reducing demands for electricity and heating 
The demand reduction measures modelled in this report have relatively little impact when considered 
on their own, reducing the Councils’ Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 6% overall. The analysis 
uses a conservative estimate of the potential re duction in demand that could be achieved; this 
suggests the need for a more ambitious progra mme of energy efficiency improvements.  
Furthermore, demand reduction is a crucial prerequisi te for successfully switching towards the use of 
electric heating and vehicles. For instance, e nergy efficiency improvements in buildings enable 
systems such as heat pumps to work at a higher leve l of efficiency. Similarly, a large-scale shift to the 
use of electric vehicles must be accompanied by a significant modal shift towards walking, cycling, 
ridesharing, and an increase in the use of public transport.  
One of the key obstacles to achieving this would likely be the absence of a po licy driver that requires 
energy efficiency upgrades to existing buildings. The Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) regulations are intended to drive progressive impr ovements in the existing st ock but the impact this 
will have is not yet clear. Therefore, it will be import ant to identify any potentia l sources of funding to 
implement this measure. AWC could also consider  lobbying the Government to promote additional 
regulations in this area. 
 
It is important to note that there are important re asons other than reducing carbon emissions which 
support refurbishing the existing stock. Fabric and building services efficiency improvements can help 
to protect consumers against changes in fuel prices, mitigate fuel poverty and improve health, 
wellbeing and comfort. Similarly, reducing vehicle mileage, if accompanied by increased walking and 
cycling, can also improve health. Alongside this, ULEVs will have significant benefits in relation to 
improvements in air quality. 
Phasing out natural gas 
Unlike electricity, which can be generated from a range of renewable technologies, natural gas is a 
fossil fuel which unavoidably emits CO 2 during combustion. In order to m eet the net zero target, it will 
therefore be crucial to phase out the use of gas, because the scale of inve stment that would be 
required to offset these emissions would be significant. 
The two main options for achieving this, based on cu rrently available technologies, are to (1) reduce 
the total demand for heat and (2) switch to using elec tric heating systems such as direct electric 
heating (DEH) or heat pumps.19 This would have the effect of reduc ing the Council’s emissions by up 
to 20%, depending on the technology used. As the elec tricity grid decarbonises, the savings would 
increase, so fuel switching (with necessary enabling works) could potentially result in a 35% decrease 
in emissions by 2030.  
                                                                                                           
19 It may be possible to decarbonise the gas grid by injecti ng it with biomethane or hydrogen, but this would require a 
technological step-change and has therefore not been considered given the timeframe for the Councils to reach net zero. Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards  
Under the MEES regulations, as of 1st April 2018, any properties newly rented out in the private 
sector must have a minimum Ener gy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating of E (some exceptions 
apply). Fines will be applied for non-compliance.  
Owners of buildings with a lower EPC rating will be required to implement energy efficiency 
measures, though consideration will be given to fi nancial viability, the anticipated payback time 
and impacts on property value.  
Over time, the Government intends to progressively increase the minimum EPC rating, meaning 
that buildings must become more efficient in order to be sold or rented. A recently-published 
consultation proposed that the minimum rating should be raised to B by 2030, subject to actions meeting a seven-year payback test.

  Heat networks have also been identified by the Gove rnment as a key component of the move to 
decarbonise the supply of heat. A heat network invo lves the centralised generation of heat to serve 
multiple buildings.  Future heat networks will need to deliver low or zero carbon heat and therefore are 
likely to utilise heat pump technology or waste heat  sources. The advantage of  a heat network is that 
a single project can enable multiple buildings to switch to a low carbon heat source in one go, speeding up the process of fuel switching. Heat networks can also enable the use of lower carbon 
heat, larger and more efficient equipment, thereby del ivering higher carbon savings with lower capital 
and operational costs than solutions for each individual building.  
Switching to ultra-low emission cars and vans 
Switching to ULEVs where possible would reduce emi ssions by around 1% if they were charged using 
national grid electricity. The savings would increase as the electricity grid decarbonises, or if the 
vehicles were charged using renewable energy – for instance, generated by PV on the roof of a 
Council-owned car park.  This would deliver savings of up to 4%. 
The electric vehicle market has seen considerable gr owth in recent years, and it is estimated that the 
price of electric, hybrid and traditional fuel  cars could converge within the next decade.20 The Councils 
should take this into account in their fleet replacement strategy.  
Although switching to ULEVs will be an important part of reaching the decarbonisation target, even if 
this goal is achieved, it creates additional challe nges. For instance, the Councils will be more reliant 
on electricity emission factors for ac hieving their net zero target. It will also create pressure on grid 
infrastructure, which may not have the capacity to  accommodate such a shift and require the use of 
more renewable electricity generation to meet demand. 
The National Grid report ‘Future Energy Scenarios 2019’  suggests that there could be between 2.7 
and 10.6 million EVs on the roads by 2030, which would present a broad-ranging challenge across all 
areas of electricity infrastructure.21 The use of smart EV charging and, potentially, vehicle-to-grid 
systems could mitigate some of the effects on peak demand and help to alleviate some of this 
pressure. 
Reducing emissions from HGVs 
At the time of writing, ultra low emission HGVs  are not widely commercially available and are not 
expected to become so in the next decade. Barring a technological step-change, this would present a 
challenge in reaching net zero emissions, which will require all the existing HGV fleet to be switched 
from diesel to ULEV alternatives. Adur & Wo rthing Councils will need to be mindful of the 
development of this technology and undertake a revi ew when the existing fleet is due for renewal. 
In the short-term the Government has suggested a target of reducing emissions from HGVs by 15% 
through other measures such as driver training . Adur & Worthing Councils will therefore need to 
assess whether such measures can be implemented within their own fleet. Reducing HGV emissions 
by 15% would reduce the Councils’ Scope 1 and 2 emissions by roughly 4% overall. 
Increasing renewable electricity generation 
As buildings and vehicles switch away from the use of fossil fuels and towards electricity, it becomes 
increasingly important to ensure that electricity is supplied from renewable sources. Reasons include: 
 Mitigating pressure on the national grid, whic h reduces the amount of resources needed for 
improving power infrastructure; 
 Providing security of electricity supply, particul arly when this is being used to supply heating; 
 Helping to protect against electricity price increases; and 
 Achieving higher CO 2e reductions in the event that the national grid does not decarbonise as 
quickly and / or as deeply as the Government intends.

  Offsetting residual emissions 
The scenario testing demonstrated that, even with the most optimistic assessment of grid and 
transport decarbonisation and highest levels of uptak e for energy efficiency measures, there will be 
significant residual CO 2e emissions that would require offsetting.  
Further work and consultation would be required to identify the most appropriate and cost-effective 
opportunities, but these might include tree planti ng or new woodland creation. The UK Woodland 
Carbon Code, for instance, provides a means of gaining certification for this type of project.22 
Reducing Scope 3 emissions  
Scope 3 emissions from water consumption can be reduced through installation of water-efficient 
fittings and behavioural change programmes. Case st udy evidence suggests that these types of 
interventions could potentially redu ce water use by more than 20%.23 
The Councils should also investigate opportuniti es for reducing energy demands and switching to 
decarbonised heat sources in the pr operties that they lease, or t hose that they own but lease to 
others. For instance, AECOM’s audit of the Worthi ng Leisure Centre has identified significant CO 2e 
savings.  
3.3 Key findings of the analysis 
The table below summarises the potential impacts of  the measures described above.  It reports the

Table 2. Key findings of the analysis 
Other opportunities to reduce emissions 
These technologies have not been included in the quantitative analysis  above, but should be 
considered by Adur & Worthing Councils to help enable their decarbonisation target: 
 District heat networks. Heat networks offer an opportunity to switch multiple buildings on to 
lower carbon heating systems and use larger and more complex technologies to deliver higher carbon savings with lower overall capital and operational costs than addressing each building 
separately. By virtue of being larger projects, t hey can be more complex to deliver, although the

  Government is providing technical support and fu nding through the Heat Network Delivery Unit 
and Heat Network Investment Program me to assist local authorities in delivering these projects. 
 Smart energy management: One of the key benefits of smar t meters that they improve 
transparency and user access to energy data, ma king it easier to identify areas of waste. 
Although it is not clear to what extent this affe cts user behaviour in the long term, the improved 
data collection could also facilitate the intr oduction of demand side response, and on a broader 
scale, help to balance energy demand and supply,  which is particularly important at peak times.24 
In principle, therefore, these have the potential to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions.  
 Battery storage: There have been significant improvements in  battery storage in  recent years, 
with implications for fuel consumption across a ll sectors. Although batteries are likely to become 
crucial to future energy infrastructure, they do not offer CO 2e savings per se. Instead, they help to 
facilitate uptake of LZC technologies by moderat ing the intermittency of wind and solar energy 
generation. Combined with EV uptake and the introduc tion of vehicle-to-grid systems, this could 
have a transformative effect on the design of energy infrastructure and the built environment.  
 Carbon capture and storage:  At present, carbon capture and storage technologies have been 
deployed as pilot projects in the UK. Although these form part of the Government’s ‘ Clean Growth 
Strategy’  (2017), at present there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic estimate of their 
potential contribution towards the decarbonisation target.25  
Potential increases in CO 2e emissions 
Adding to the Councils’ building portfolio 
In the event that Adur & Worthing Councils build or purchase additional buildings, this would likely 
increase the Councils’ Scope 1 and 2 emissions. An y increase will make the decarbonisation target 
more difficult to achieve and increase the cost of mitigation measures and offs etting. Therefore, it will 
be vital to ensure that any new buildings are constr ucted or retrofitted to be capable of becoming net 
zero in operation26 and incorporate LZC technologies as standard.  
Although not captured in existing datasets, it is  also worth noting that there are Scope 3 CO 2e 
emissions associated with the construction and demo lition process itself, as well as the materials 
used in construction. In order to minimise t hese emissions, the Councils should also consider: 
 Carrying out a comprehensive options assessment  to consider whether it is necessary to 
build new, and how to maximise the use of existing buildings, materials, and infrastructure; 
 Use of renewable energy on-sit e (i.e. avoid diesel generators); 
 Routinely carrying out embodied carbon lif ecycle assessments of all proposals;  
 Maximising the end-of-life value of any buildings, materials and infrastructure that cannot be 
reused by assessing opportunities for reclamat ion, remanufacturing, recycling, etc.; and 
 Designing new buildings to fac ilitate maintenance (e.g. through use of robust materials) and 
future changes in use (e.g. generous floor to ceiling heights) so that, in the future, demolition 
and new construction can be avoided. 
A note on overheating, cooling and climate change 
Although one of the biggest challenges in decarbonising buildings in the UK relates to heat demand, it 
is generally agreed that demand for cooling is likely to increase in the future as a result of climate 
change.27 Therefore, when considering interventions in t heir own building stock, it will be important for 
Adur & Worthing Councils to: 
 Prioritise passive cooling measures, in or der to reduce the need for air conditioning;  
 Deliver cooling efficiently usi ng highly efficient systems; and

  4. Achieving Net Zero: A plan for Adur & Worthing 
4.1 Action Plan 
Key areas of influence 
As discussed previously, although the Councils have  control over their own Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
to some extent, achieving the decarbonisation ta rget will also depend on wider changes, including 
some that occur on a primarily national or regional  level. However, the Councils do have opportunities 
to exert pressure across multiple spheres of influence, even if this is indirect, as illustrated in Figure 6. 
 
Figure 6: Adur & Worthing Councils - Spheres of influence 
On this basis, potential responses from Adur & Worthing Councils could include: 
 Direct control: Taking a leadership role by adopting best practices wherever possible by 
reducing energy demand in their own buildings, adopting behavioural change programmes, 
switching to renewable energy sources and adopting a zero-emission vehicle fleet. 
 Buildings /services owned but not operated by the Councils:  Engaging with tenants and 
service users to promote demand reduction measures, encourage uptake of renewables, etc. 
 Procurement:  Ensuring that there is a rigorous approach to embedding sustainability into 
procurement, e.g. with reference to Governme nt Buying Standards, the Flexible Framework, 
and British Standard 8903:2010. 
In addition to mitigating their own emissions, the C ouncils should also take a leadership role and 
consider ways they can exert influence within the local area and their supply chain; for instance: 
 Influence through funding: For instance, by offering subsidies to SMEs wishing to undertake 
building energy audits. 
 Influence through policy: Supporting the delivery of heat  networks and renewable energy 
projects within the area by taking a positi ve approach to renewable energy generation in 
planning policies and decision-making. 
 Minimising emissions from transport in the local area through design of infrastructure and 
traffic management, adopting an approach to s patial planning that reduces reliance on private 
vehicles, and supporting initiatives to encourage the use of public transport, ridesharing, 
walking and cycling. 
 Supporting higher standards of sustainable design and construction.  This could be done 
through awareness and training; for instance, by es tablishing best practice networks or offering 
training to facilities managers. 
 Exerting indirect national influence: Lobbying the Government to bring forward more 
ambitious policies (e.g. transport strategies, research and development, updates to Building 
Regulations). Indirect national influence  Indirect local influence  Influence through policy  Influence through funding  Direct control / influence  Adur & Worthing Council – Carbon Neutral Plan    AECOM

  Action Plan  
The following pages describe a set of proposed actions for Adur & Worthing Councils that reflect the findings of the analysis p resented in Sections 2 and 3. These 
actions must be reviewed and agreed by the Council prior to being adopted and taken forward. The proposed actions have been pre sented with the following 
information: 
─ Reference code 
─ Action – Summary of the proposed action 
─ Description  – Any other relevant details relating to the proposed action 
─ Timeframe  – Describes the timeframe (short, medium or long-term) during which the proposed action needs to be initiated, either short te rm (0-6 months), 
medium term (6-12 months) or long term (1-5 years) 
─ Effectiveness – Framed in terms of the level of potential CO 2e reductions that could be achieved, informed by the analysis presented in Sections 2 and 3 
─ Deliverability/Roles – Key considerations and relative effort required, considering fa ctors such as Adur & Worthing Councils’ level of influence or role in 
delivery and required involvement of other parties 
─ Investment Resource implications  – Describes the relative level of resource (e.g. officer ti me) that Adur & Worthing Councils would need to commit in order 
to deliver the proposed action. Where possible / applicable, we ha ve provided an estimate of the scale of investment required, based on published industry 
figures and AECOM’s own experience in  delivering similar projects.  
Note that these are preliminary figures intended only to provid e a sense of potential scale of investment required, subject to further detailed analysis. These are 
labelled as ‘investments’ rather than costs because many of them have potential financial returns and some or all of the requir ed financing could come from other 
parties. 
─ Priority  – Sets out the relative priority of the proposed action, based on the considerations listed above. Note that some projects wit h a higher priority ranking 
may not result directly in carbon  savings but enable other high-priority actions to take  place. This is illustrated in the diagram below.

installation of batteries is likely to make more commercial sense for larger projects. If a heat pump led heat 
network is

Shoreham Centre (Action H2), potentially along with PV and EV charging), this may be of sufficient scale to make a battery system viable.  Battery systems can be 
profitable where they combine the income from peak shaving, avoidance of use of service charges, arbitraging grid prices with time of use tariffs, frequency response contracts and additional value of PV and/or EVs.  Medium-Low Adur & Worthing Council – Carbon Neutral Plan    AECOM

  4.2 Measuring progress 
Monitoring and review 
We recommend that the Councils set up a monitoring and review process to assess progress against 
the CO 2e emission projections and other targets. This could be done on an annual basis or, to align 
with the Committee on Climate Change’s national carbon budgets, be split into 5-year periods.  
Quarterly:   Monitor progress against the Carbon Neutral Plan  
 Report to members and partners 
Annually: 
 Report progress to internal and external audiences 
 Monitor renewable energy generat ion and installed capacity 
 Monitoring of the cost benefits achieved (for instance, by estimating the energy savings that are 
achieved and the costs avoided as a result)  
In addition to reporting on the steps taken to achieve specific actions, the priorities of this Carbon 
Neutral Plan should be reviewed on an annual basis. This review should account for broader factors 
such as policy or technological changes; where appropriate, the Carbon Neutral Plan should be updated to reflect such changes. 
Assessment metrics 
In addition to annual CO 2e emissions, other metrics can be used to monitor positive enabling steps 
taken by Adur & Worthing Councils. Some examples are provided in the table below, which could be 
used to set additional quantitative targets.  
 Topic Method 
1 Deployment of low carbon heat ing systems (heat pumps and 
heat networks) in Council-owned properties Councils to maintain internal 
records

  5. Conclusion 
5.1 Recommendations 
The measures and actions described in this Carbon Neutral Plan reflect the following overarching 
recommendations: 
 Adur & Worthing Councils should take a leadership role in reducing CO 2e emissions by examining 
their own operations, buildings, vehicle flee t, services and investments and identifying best 
practice measures that can be implemented. 
 The Councils should recognise that demand redu ction, fuel switching and LZC energy generation 
are top priorities. However, given that some ca rbon offsetting will inevitably be required to meet 
the decarbonisation target, the Councils should im mediately start carrying out further research to 
understand the offsetting opportunities that might be available. 
Some of the actions laid out in this Plan will re ly on broader trend s that are outside of the Councils’ 
control. Therefore: 
 The Councils should proactively support other Local Authorities and organisations in delivering 
the actions required to reach net zero carbon. The SLES SMARTHUBS project is an example of 
an opportunity for the Councils to exert indirect influence in this regard. 
 The Councils should take steps to lobby t he Government to achieve more rapid and deeper 
carbon reductions across key priority areas, in cluding higher energy efficiency standards for new 
and existing buildings, policies that support uptake of renewable and low carbon technologies, and the development of low carbon transport and infrastructure.  
 The Councils should proactively support such measures through their own planning policy and 
decisions. In particular, the Councils should take a proactive and positive attitude towards 
increasing the amount of local LZC energy generat ion as an important means of ‘doing their part’ 
on national electricity grid decarbonisation. Simila rly, they should seek to facilitate ULEV uptake 
wherever possible. 
5.2 Next steps 
Based on the findings of this report, we propose the following immediate next steps: 
 Disseminate findings of this report and carry out further consultation to review and approve the 
Carbon Neutral Plan. 
 Begin the process of reaching out to stakehol ders, including local authorities, LEPs, utility 
companies (e.g. UKPN, Southern Gas), government departments / agencies (e.g. Department for 
Transport, Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Forestry Commission), and others (e.g. WRAP) to identify opport unities for collaboration and engagement. 
 Review any ongoing or near future projects that are relevant to the measures listed in the Carbon 
Neutral Plan to ensure that activities are well-co ordinated and integrated. This would include, for 
instance, plans for redeveloping the Civic Quar ter, plans to reduce vehicle mileage in waste 
collection routes, and plans to refurbish or replac e existing buildings, in addition to the Council’s 
general strategies for building management or fleet replacement.   
5.3 A final note 
The results of this analysis show that the route towards becoming carbon neutral will require a strong level of ambition and commitment, backed up by signif icant interventions and in vestment across Adur 
& Worthing Councils’ operations. Although the study shows that m eeting the carbon neutral ambition 
will rely upon some factors outside of the Councils ’ control, such as the decarbonisation of the grid

   – Modelling methodology Appendix A
A.1 Data sources  
The table below summarises the data used in es tablishing Adur & Worthing Councils’ baseline CO 2e 
emissions.  
Category Description Data used in this analysis 
Scope 1 Direct emissions from 
sources owned or controlled by the reporting organisation  Metered gas data (for buildings where the Councils pay 
the gas bills) (kWh and £) 
Mileage for Council-owned vehicle fleet and pool cars, 
along with vehicle make/model and age 
Scope 2 Indirect emissions from the 
generation of energy purchased by the reporting organisation Metered electricity data (for buildings where the Councils 
pay the electricity bills) (kWh and £) 
Note that, where data was unavailable, CIBSE Guide F 
2012 ‘typical practice’ benchmarks for ‘local government office’ have been used to estimate fuel consumption. 
Scope 3 Indirect emissions that result 
from other activities that occur in the value chain of the reporting organisation, either upstream or downstream. Metered water use data (m
3) 
Records of business travel by the Councils’ employees 
(cost data provided; mileage estimated from £/mi) 
 
Although a sense-checking exercise was carried out to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the 
data provided by Adur & Worthi ng Councils, AECOM acce pts no responsi bility for any errors or 
omissions therein. 
A.2 Baseline carbon emissions 
General approach 
The carbon emissions baseline was estimated in co mpliance with the methodology and conversion 
factors for greenhouse gas emissions reporting published by BEIS in 2019. 
CO 2e figures for different fuel types and activities were taken from the BEIS ‘Green Book 
Supplementary Guidance: Toolkit for valuing changes in greenhouse gas emissions, Table 1’  (2019). 
These include figures for CO 2e emissions from: 
 Use of natural gas (kgCO 2e / kWh) 
 Use of UK grid electricity (kgCO 2e / kWh) 
 Distance travelled (figures are provided  for various different vehicle types) (kgCO 2e / km) 
 Water consumption (kg CO 2e / m3) 
Figures for electricity and gas consumption (kWh),  vehicle mileage (km) and water consumption (m3) 
were multiplied by these CO 2e figures to obtain an estimate of the total emissions from each category.  
Estimating vehicle mileage 
Adur & Worthing councils provided AECOM with a dataset of vehicles which included the total 
mileage, the fuel type, the year of manufacture and the registration number of each vehicle.  
In order to estimate emissions from the Councils ’ vehicle fleet, average yearly mileage figures were 
calculated based on the total mileage and the years in service for each vehicle. Then, the annual 
carbon emission figures for vehicles up to 3.5 t were estimated based on the fuel type, revenue Adur & Worthing Council – Carbon Neutral Plan    AECOM 
 
 
  
Prepared for:  Adur & Worthing Councils  47 
  weight (obtained from gov.uk MOT database35 using registration numbers) and the corresponding 
CO 2e figures provided by the BEIS under Scope 1. The same procedure was followed for the heavier 
vehicles using the average laden values provided by BEIS. 
In order to estimate emissions from pool car usage, a similar approach was taken. The council 
provided a dataset which included fuel types, trip  distances and registration numbers of all the 
vehicles hired. The emissions were estimated based  on the fuel type, trip distances, the engine size 
(also obtained from the gov.uk MOT database) and the corresponding CO 2e figures provided by the 
BEIS under Scope 3 (‘business travel’); however, these are included in Scope 1 in this report because 
Adur & Worthing Councils control the operation these vehicles. 
A.3 Carbon emission projections 
The carbon emissions projections are carried out  based on the following key assumptions. 
Grid decarbonisation pathway 
Carbon emission factors (CEFs) for electric ity were taken from HM Treasury/BEIS ‘Green Book 
Supplementary Guidance: Toolkit for valuing changes in greenhouse gas emissions, Table 1’  (2019) 
which is intended for use by organisations reporting on  their greenhouse gas emi ssions. Note that this 
trajectory reflects the level of decarbonisation that  would be necessary for the UK to meet its current 
decarbonisation targets. It is not a projection of  the likely emissions from grid electricity.  
Electricity demand reduction 
Evidence suggests that reductio ns of around 5% can be achieved through measures such as 
behavioural changes, smart metering, and zone lighting.  Case studies suggest that greater reductions 
are possible for some organisations. However, in re cognition of the fact that electricity use has 
increased in the past decade due to factors such as  increasing use of electronic appliances, 5% has 
been used as a conservative estimate.  
The model assumes that total electricity consumpt ion will decrease linearly through the year 2030, at 
which point this reduction will be achieved.  
Heating demand reduction from energy efficiency measures 
Evidence from the National Energy Efficiency Database (NEED) indicates that installing multiple 
energy saving measures (such as cavity wall or loft insulation) can reduce heating bills by around 10%. From a technical standpoint, higher savings (over 75% in some properties) could be achieved with more ambitious retrofitting strategies,
36 so this assumption has been used as a conservative 
estimate.  
This would not necessarily require all buildings to undergo a retrofit – it represents an average across 
the entire stock. In other words, some buildings could be retrofitted to a higher standard, while others 
(such as Listed buildings) receive no upgrades.  
The model assumes that total gas consumption will decrease linearly through the year 2030, at which 
point this reduction will be achieved.  
Impact of fuel switching 
This calculation assumes that the metered gas c onsumption is delivered by individual gas boilers 
(80% efficiency). The total metered gas consumption data is used to provide a rough estimate of the 
amount of electricity that would be required if this level of demand was instead met using direct electric heating (100% efficiency) or heat pumps (C OP of 2.5, which is intended as a conservative 
estimate that reflects the performance of air source heat pumps in situ).  
It is assumed that the Crematorium will also switch  to an electric system offering similar performance 
levels (see energy audit report for further details).

36 https://passipedia.org/certification/enerphit  Adur & Worthing Council – Carbon Neutral Plan    AECOM 
 
 
  
Prepared for:  Adur & Worthing Councils  48 
  The model assumes that 90% of Council-owned build ings will switch to an electric heating system by 
2030. This would require an ambitious programme of heating system replacement with significant cost 
implications. Therefore, the calc ulation also assumes that 50% of  the new heating systems will be 
DEH and 50% will be ASHP as an illustrative scenario,  in recognition of the fact that DEH may be 
cheaper and more practical to install. Additional carbon reductions could pot entially be achieved if 
more systems were replaced with ASHPs.  
The model assumes that gas heating systems will be replaced with electric heating systems at a 
consistent rate (i.e. linearly) to 2030.  
Vehicle mileage reduction 
According to the ‘Road to Zero’  report: ‘Evidence from 60,000 fleet driver s receiving training through 
the Energy Saving Trust (EST), a key partner supporting the efficient motoring agenda, gave an 
average 15% saving of fuel and CO 2 […] Organisations that have incorporated a wider package of 
behavioural and procedural measures in managing their fleets […] have delivered typical emission 
savings of between 10-30%.’  
In this report we have assumed a 10% reduction in mileage is possible across the organisation, based 
on case study evidence,37 and that emissions from HGVs could decrease by up to15%. 
The model assumes that a 10% reduction in either jour neys, vehicles, or miles travelled will result in a 
10% reduction in CO 2e emissions from those vehicles. In realit y, a travel strategy aimed at reducing 
emissions would likely seek to target certain types of  trips, vehicles, or users, so this approach should 
be understood as a rough estimate. However, for t he purpose of this analysis, it is considered 
sufficient to show a simple proportional reduction to highlight the relative scale of impact such a measure could have, relative to other interventions. 
Impact of switching to ULEVs 
Based on the estimated mileage for each vehicle type, we have re-calculated CO 2e emissions using 
BEIS Green Guide figures for electric vehicles.  
Carbon savings from LZC energy generation 
Carbon savings from LZC energy gen eration are based on the amount of national grid electricity that 
would be offset by renewable electricity.  
The user inputs a total figure for the amount of LZ C capacity that will be installed by 2030, and the 
model assumes that the total savings increase linearly up to that point. 
An estimate is then made of the potential amount of  renewable electricity that could be generated by 
those technologies (large-scale PV or wind). The el ectricity generation figure is multiplied by the CEF 
for a given year to provide an estimate of the total CO 2e savings in a given year. 
 Large-scale PV:  Assumed output of 800 kWh/kWp based on typical performance in the UK 
 Large-scale onshore wind:  Capacity factor based on renewable energy capacity and 
generation figures for Adur and Worthing, per BEIS, ‘Renewable energy by Local Authority’  
(2019) 
Note that, as the electricity grid decarbonises, more LZC energy generation is required to offset any 
residual emissions. Therefore, although the amount of  LZC capacity is assumed to increase linearly, 
the savings per MW decrease as time goes on. 
Carbon reductions from woodla nd creation and tree planting 
Based on nation-wide statistics from the Woodland Carbon Code, new woodlands created from low-
grade agricultural land have the potential to sequester around 356 tCO 2e per hectare over 100 years, 
or 3.56 tCO 2e per hectare per year on average.

Prepared for:  Adur & Worthing Councils  49 
  It is assumed that the amount of new woodland in creases linearly to 2030. Based on user inputs for 
the number of hectares planted, the model calculates  the total potential carbon reduction potential. 
This is subtracted from the total estimated carbon  emissions following adoption of all intervention 
measures, after accounting for renewable energy generation.
