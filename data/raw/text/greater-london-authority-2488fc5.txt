CLIMATE ACTION PLAN
Image © TfL What has London  
committed to? 
The Mayor of London has some of the  
most ambitious plans to tackle climate  
change in the world. 
In 2015, the UK signed up to the 
Paris Agreement along with 178 other 
countries. The aim was to try to limit 
the global average temperature rise 
to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. 
The IPCC Special Report  highlighted   
the huge impacts there would be if  
average temperature increases exceed  
1.5C. It would affect weather patterns,  
sea level rise, create food and water  
shortages, and affect human security  
and economic growth. 
The w orld is now clearly in the midst   
of a climate emergency . The Mayor's  
London Environment Strategy (May  
2018)  was one of the first plans of any 
world city to be c ompatible with the 
highest ambition of the Paris Agreement. 
It commits London to being a zero 
carbon city by 2050. It sets out the 
actions the Mayor will take, within his 
powers, to get there as soon as possible. 
Our research shows that to up the pace of  
action, the Mayor will need more po wers  
and funding from national government.  
That is the only way to tackle this most  
urgent issue and protect Londoners both  
now and in the future.

CLIMATE ACTION PLAN
How will we 
get there? 
T o understand how we'll meet our target, 
we did a detailed 'bottom-up' analysis. 
We used spatial models of London's 
buildings and energy systems to assess 
the impact of specific policies, as well as 
the cost implications. We used the following approach: 
Modelling approach 
Identify suite of policy measures 
needed to transition to a zero emissions 
transport network and enable a shift to 
public transport, cycling and walking 
Identify suite of policy measures   
needed to improve energy efficiency   
in London’s buildings1 
Use the modelled transport and energy  
efficiency measures to de velop four  
scenarios for achieving a zero carbon  
energy and transpor t system to 20502 
Identify further measures required to  
meet the 2050 zero carbon target Set carbon budgets for the next 15   
years to get us on the right path The four scenarios rely on a 
different mix of technologies: 
1 - Decentralised energy  
focus on heat networks 
2 - High electrification  
heat pumps dominate (electric heating) 
3 - Decarbonised gas  
Hydrogen replaces gas in the gas grid.  
Relies on carbon c apture and storage 
4 - Patchwork 
Combination of heat pumps,  
 heat networks and a partial   
hydrogen network 
1 Arup (2018) Zero Carbon Buildings Policies london.gov.uk/zero-carbon-plan 
2 Element Energy (2018) Zero Carbon Energy Systems london.gov.uk/zero-carbon-plan All four scenarios achieve deep 
decarbonisation but some have higher 
cumulative emissions and are more 
risky. For example, the decarbonised 
gas scenario relies on carbon capture 
and storage to enable high volumes of 
hydrogen to be made from natural gas. 
This has not yet been proven at scale 
and there are no firm plans to roll 
this out nationally. In contrast, the 
Patchwork scenario used in our 1.5C 
pathway is less risky because it 
relies on a mix of technologies. Understanding these different pathways 
has enabled us to set an ambitious 
emissions pathway in line with the IPCC 
recommendations. It will see London 
reduce its emissions by 60 per cent on 
1990 levels by 2030 and by nearly 80 
per cent by 2040.

Figure 1: Element report, p9 CLIMATE ACTION PLANCarbon budgets  place a recommended 
limit on London’s carbon emissions 
over the next 15 years. London’s carbon 
budgets are more ambitious than the 
national government's and set us on our 
way to be a zero carbon city by 2050. 
Carbon budgets help London’s 
businesses, communities, boroughs,  
the Mayor and national government 
manage the transition to zero carbon, so 
that we don’t leave everything until the 
last minute, incurring greater cost. Budgets spread over five year periods 
also help manage annual changes in 
energy demand due to factors like the  
weather. For example, heating emissions 
may go up in a cold winter. 
Meeting the next three budgets will 
require strong action to improve energy 
efficiency and greater use of public 
transport and cycling. This should 
be followed by a big increase in the 
electrification of heat and transport.

Figure 2: London Environment Strategy, p127 Key messages 
1. We urgently need to increase the 
number of buildings retrofitted with 
energy efficiency measures. • All our pathways to zero carbon in 
2050 rely on a high level of energy 
efficiency building retrofits by 2030. 
Only 35 per cent of homes currently 
achieve adequate energy efficiency 
performance (EPC C or above) and 
many will still be in use by 2050.  
At least 70 per cent of London’s 
buildings need to reach EPC C  
by 2030 . 
• However, national government 
support for energy efficiency was 
cut drastically in 2012 and building 
retrofits have fallen since then. 
Londoners have also struggled to 
access the national programmes  
that do exist.

 • Energy efficiency enables a switch  
to lo
w carbon heating. Heat pumps  
and district heat networks are most  
effective in buildings with reasonable  
energy efficiency (EPC C or above).  
This is due to the lower temperature   
of these systems; they provide heat  
more slowly so will not warm up a  
leaky building.  
• Howe
ver
, achieving this would  
require building retrofit rates  
per year to reach more than  
four times their historical peak.  
In 2012, around 40,000 houses  
in London were reached with  
energy efficiency programmes. 
By the mid 2020s we would  
need to reach nearly 160,000.  
• Early action will reduce cumulative  
c
arbon emissions; the carbon intensity  
of the electricity grid is likely to fall  
further as more renewables power   
the national grid. That means any   
cuts in electricity use in buildings   
for heating and lighting we make   
now, will save more carbon than   
reductions in future. •  A five year dela
y could lead   
to an additional 33 MtCO2e,  
or a seven per cent increase   
in total emissions over the   
modelled period.  
•  Retrofitting a building now reduces  
energy bills sooner which is especially  
important f
or the fuel poor. The  
building also starts to save carbon  
straight away. Waiting longer would  
mean that more buildings would need  
to be retrofitted to achieve the same  
cumulative carbon reduction.   
•  If we delay these energy  
efficiency actions until 2022,   
it will cost ar
ound £2.5bn more  
to achieve the same cumulative  
carbon reductions.

2. Strong national government policy  
and programmes are needed to get  
London’s buildings to the required  
levels of energy efficiency . •  Regulation with effective enforcement  
to bring buildings up to an EPC C  
rating will be the best way to achiev e  
the building energy efficiency  
levels needed. This includes setting  
Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards  
to EPC C across all building types.

installing the required number  
of energy efficiency measures  
to total £10bn by 2050. National  
government must put in place  
new policies to start a ttracting  
investment into  these measures.  •  Improving social housing will require  
much greater investment at a national  
level. Further work is needed to  
understand how these measures can  
be funded at the buildings level.

 3. London's path towards zero  
carbon relies on continued grid  
decarbonisation and more ambitious  
national government action. 
• Significant carbon reductions have  
and will be achieved by electricity  
sector decarbonisation. However,  
greater action is needed to   
reach our carbon targets. •  With only the levels of grid electricity  
decarbonisation c ommitted to in  
current national go vernment policy,  
London's emissions will only be 35 per  
cent lower than 1990 levels by 2050.  
•  If government further  
decarbonised energy systems  
and buildings UK wide, we could  
reduce carbon by an extra 30   
per cent. This is in line with  
current  government policies   
and proposals to  achieve  UK  
carbon budgets.

Figure 6: London Environment Strategy, p208 • The remainder of emissions requires 
further action. This c ould either be 
from national government , or from 
them devolving powers and resources 
to the Mayor or boroughs to deliver 
in London. 
• It will be difficult to eliminate some 
residual emissions from old building 
stock, aviation and parts of industry. 
The zero carbon pathway assumes 
there will be 10 per cent residual 
emissions. These will need to be 
offset through negative emissions 
technologies such as carbon capture 
and storage or tree planting. 
• The only way London can reach zero 
carbon faster than currently modelled 
is for the government to increase its 
action sooner. Alternatively, London 
needs to be given more funding and 
powers to enable it to take the action. “I’m doing 
everything in my 
power to reduce 
London’s carbon 
footprint, and 
going further 
and faster 
than national 
government to 
make London 
a zero-carbon 
city by 2050.”

CLIMATE ACTION PLAN
Image © TfL 4. Any increases in L ondon’s energy  
demand should be offset by energy  
efficiency deployment and increasing  
use of smart technology to smooth  
peaks in demand. 
•  We modelled peak electricity  
demand under each scenario down to  
substation level to assess the impacts  
of increasing numbers of heat pumps  
and electric vehicles.  
•  Meeting the additional load from  
heat pumps and electric vehicle  
charging doesn't have to mean  
building large scale electricity  
generation capacity. In most  scenarios, improvements in  
energy efficiency and demand  
side flexibility will be enough to  
manage the additional peak load.  
•  Our modelling showed that strong  
energy efficiency policy could enable  
peak electricity demand to decline   
to 2035. 
•  Beyond 2035 only the high  
electrification scenario results in a big  
increase in London’s peak demand.  
•  Peak demand can also be reduced by  
demand side response initiatives, such  
as time of use tariffs.

5. Costs associated with grid up grades  
should be manageable. 
•  Cumulative electricity grid upgrade  
costs in all scenarios are less than  
£4bn to 2050. •  T o put that into perspective, the  
cumulative cost of London's electricity  
bills to 2050 will be over £200bn. 
•  This analysis also does not consider  
the cost to London if nothing is done  
to reduce emissions and London has  
to pay to adapt to climate change  
impacts. These costs could be many  
times higher.

6. Government must decide which low 
carbon heat pathway the UK will take 
by the mid-2020s at the latest. In the meantime, there are important  
short-term actions London and the  
national go vernment should focus on.   
These include rapidly scaling up energy  efficiency improvements, rolling out heat  
networks and heat pumps, and taking   
a coor dinated approach to electric   
vehicle charging.

7. Each different energy system 
pathway has its own pros and 
cons. However, costs may be similar 
and business as usual is not the 
cheapest option. Some of the zero carbon pathways have 
lower fuel and energy bill costs than the 
business as usual pathway. This offsets 
the further investment in buildings and 
low carbon infrastructure needed.

8. Decarbonising transport and  
increasing use of active and public  
transport remains a key objective   
for London.

all trips in London should be made  
by sustainable modes of tr ansport  
including cycling, walking and   
public transport . •  By 2050, all of London’s motorised  
road transport will need to be battery  
electric or fuel cell electric vehicles.

(EVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles  
(FCEVs) run on hydrogen depends   
on the wider energy scenario. FCEVs  
will only be an option at scale in the  
decarbonised gas scenario .

CLIMATE ACTION PLAN
What role will the 
Mayor and others 
play in realising 
London’s ambition? 
The Mayor has already set out his 
London Environment Strategy  and put 
a number of policies and programmes 
in place to help London become a zero 
carbon city. Here we outline some of the 
key actions needed to make this happen. 
However, it's not just the Mayor 
that needs to act. We can all play 
a part. What will the Mayor and the 
GLA group do? 
• Work with boroughs and other 
stakeholders to deliver a zero 
carbon transport system by 2050. 
This includes the new T-Charge and 
Ultra Low Emission Zone, development 
of a public network of rapid EV 
chargers, no longer licensing new 
diesel taxis and making sure all new 
taxis are zero emissions capable, and 
rolling out electric buses. 
• Ensure new buildings are zero 
carbon through setting strong 
policy through the London Plan. • Support boroughs, Londoners and 
businesses to do their part through 
technical and support frameworks for 
energy efficiency and heat networks, 
and grant programmes. 
• Lead by example to make all GLA 
buildings more energy efficient 
and transition vehicle fleets to zero 
emissions. We will also increase 
renewables on our estates, and use 
collective energy procurement to 
encourage new renewable projects 
inside and outside London. • Work with pension funds and other 
investors to divest from fossil fuels 
and boost investment in energy 
efficiency, low carbon transport and 
low carbon heat solutions. 
• Work with the private sector to drive 
action, for example, through the 
EV taskforce and London Business 
Climate Leaders group. 
• Continue to call on national 
government to introduce policies 
and incentives to enable a 1.5C 
compatible pathway.  What can London bor oughs do? 
•  Ensure new buildings comply with  
London Plan zero carbon policies. 
•  Collect and use c
arbon offset funds  
from new developments to drive  
carbon reductions across   
the boroughs. 
•  Work with the Mayor and GLA group  
on rolling-out a public network of rapid  
EV chargers and the delivery of zero  
emission zones. 
•  Accelerate building stock  
improvements, including building  
fabric using support from the Mayor’s  
Energy for Londoners programmes  
RE:FIT and RE:NEW. 
•  Roll out solar PV and storage  
installations on their building   
stock and land. 
•  Use heat mapping and energy  
masterplans to identify heat network  
opportunities. Use support from the  
government’s Heat Network Delivery  
Unit and GLA Decentralised Energy  
Enabling Project to speed up the build  
out of heat networks. •  Work with pension funds and other  
inv
estors to divest from fossil fuels  
and increase investment in energy  
efficiency, low carbon transport and  
low carbon heat solutions. 
•  Use low cost funding available from  
the Mayor for energy efficiency   
and renewable projects from the   
£500m Mayor’s Energy Efficiency   
Fund (MEEF). What does the national gov
ernment  
need to do? 
•  P
rovide the regulatory framework and  
financial support for energy efficiency: -  Allocate funds to tackle harder, more  
expensive measures, for example
,  
solid wall insulation 
-  Bring in Minimum Energy Efficiency  
standard regulations for all buildings  
and remo
ve loopholes from   
existing regulations 
-  Provide greater support and  
incentives for home owners and  
SMEs t
o improve their buildings,   
for example, a successor to the   
failed Green Deal  
-  Ensure London gets its fair share of  
funding under the Energy Company  
Obligation (ECO) by reforming the  
s
cheme to better target hard to treat  
homes or setting regional targets. 
•  Help London generate more   
clean energy:  
-  Provide support for small scale solar  
-  Ensure tax regime supports uptake of  
stor
age, solar and other renewables 
- 
 Provide direct support for   
community energy -  Establish a clear and realistic plan  
for the long
-term decarbonisation   
of heat 
-  Offer long term support for  
renewable heat projects and heat  
network
s beyond 2020/21 
-  Ensure adequate customer  
protection and quality control   
f
or heat networks and heat   
pump installations 
•  Support the transition to   
sustainable transport: 
 - Ensure adequate financial support  
is pro
vided to buyers of electric  
v
ehicles to maintain demand for new  
vehicles so costs continue to fall 
 - Provide a targeted scrappage  
scheme which als
o assists with wider  
health, transport and envir
onmental  
objectives. It should also offer  
rewards for changing behaviour  
rather than just focus on payments   
 to help buy a new car 
-  Commit funding for charging  
infrastructure beyond 2020 to  
both support the private sector in  
expanding charging infrastructure  
and increase residential on-  
street charging 33 CLIMATE ACTION PLAN   
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
   35 CLIMATE ACTION PLAN 
What role could businesses play? There are a number of ways businesses  
can help make London a zero carbon   
city by 2050.   
Here are some of the most important: •  Measure and report on greenhouse  
gas emissions and set long   
term targets.  
•  Adhere t
o Minimum Energy Efficiency  
Standards (MEES) building regulations.  
•  Ensure ne
w buildings are as energy  
efficient as possible and include  
measures to reduce cooling needs.  
•  L
ook to connect new buildings to low  
carbon heat networks to us
e local  
sources of waste heat or install   
heat pumps. 
•  Replace old boilers with more  
efficient ones and consider renewable  
options like heat pumps. Support is  
a
vailable for SMEs through Cleaner  
Heat Cashback or for all businesses  
through the Renewable Heat Incentive. 
•  Optimise fleet movements and switch  
owned vehicles to electric vehicles.  •  Use procur ement to encourage  
decarbonisation, for example,   
switch to additional green electricity  
and gas tariffs.  
•  Work with staff to drive behavioural  
changes that help reduce business  
emissions, for example, travel less.  What can all Londoners do
? 
There are many actions that L
ondoners 
can take. 
Here are some of the most important: 
• Get an Energy Performance Certificate 
(EPC) assessment to see how best to improve your home. 
• As landlords you should adhere to Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards, bring poorly performing buildings up to a higher rating and develop a plan to improve all your stock. 
• Explore whether your home is suitable for solar and/or electricity storage installations. Look at installing a low carbon heat technology so you can benefit from the Renewable Heat Incentive. 
• Only buy energy efficient appliances. 
• Walk, cycle or use public transport instead of driving where possible. Use car clubs, ideally those with electric or hybrid vehicles. 
• Switch energy supplier to a green tariff for electricity and gas.  #zerocarbonlondon
