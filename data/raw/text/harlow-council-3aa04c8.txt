RECOMMENDED  that:  
 
A The Working  Group  notes the report and the progress made to date . 
 
 
BACKGROUND  
 
1. The Cli mate Change Act 2008 established  a legally binding target to reduce the 
UK’s greenhou se gas emissions by at least 80 per cent  in 2050 from 1990 
levels.  In June 2019, the Government passed new laws to reduce all 
greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.  
 
2. The Council recognises the importance of reducing its carbon footprint and use 
of resources in both its own operations and across the district  and how this 
contributes to government legislation . In 2011 the  Council adopted its first 
Carbon Management Plan, ac hieving  a 25 per cent  reduction o ver five  years 
from building and transport related emissions, totalling 1083 tonnes of carbon. 
The Council’s Carbon  Management Plan 2016 -2021  set the Council a target to 
reduce its carbon emissions by 25 per cent  from its 2 014/15 baseline emissions 
of 2,700,000kg (2,700 tonnes), the equivalent to 675 tonnes.  On 18  July 2019, 
Cabinet agreed to extend the Carbon Management Plan timeline to 2021/22, 
unless the target is reached prior to this date.  
 
3. At the Full Council meeting o f 11 July 2019, Councillors unanimously backed a 
motion to declare a climate emergency in Harlow. The C ouncil has made a 
number of commitments to prevent climate change , including  reducing the 
council’s net carbon emissions as far as possible and reducing the carbon 
footprint at a greater rate than it is already committed to do so , along with 
actions relating the effects of activities, beyond those directly emitting carbon 
into the atmosphere, on the wider environment.  
 
 
 
 ISSUES/PROPOSALS  
 
4. It has been iden tified that the climate emergency motion can be divided into 
three main work streams: Property, Environment and Community Leadership. 
Specific actions identified as part of the climate emergency declaration include 
installing photovoltaic panels on all pub lic council buildings within the next two 
years where possible and new council built houses having a minimal carbon 
footprint. Progress on these actions is already being made . This includes : 
 
a) Updated feasibility studies for photovoltaic panel installation at Civic 
Centre, Latton Bush Centre, Playhouse and Mead Park Depot are 
being commissioned, along with new studies for Leah Manning and 
Harlow Museum (previous studies in 2011 found installation to be 
unfeasible on grounds of cost, but there has been suffic ient  reduction 
in manufacturing costs for panels to re -visit this); and  
 
b) Officers  actively exploring options to minimise the carbon footprint of 
properties within its house building programme - set to deliver 177 new 
homes by 2022/23 - including construct ion process. Such options 
include:  
 
i) Installation of insulation levels in line with Passivhaus standards;  
 
ii) Alternative heating solutions in line with Climate Change 
Committee recommendations;  
 
iii) Methods of increasing biodiversity, including SuDS, at each site ; 
 
iv) Identifying and using ‘green’ materials with low/zero carbon 
footprint;  
 
v) Methods of reducing fleet and plant emissions during the 
construction of each site; and  
 
vi) Installation of electric car charge points at a rate of one  per 20 
homes for new developments  
 
5. The climate emergency motion also includes the creation of an action plan which 
focuses on reducing the impact of day to day living on the environment beyond 
that caused by greenhouse gas emissions. A number of short, me dium and long 
term proposals for consideration have been set out for each of the three climate 
emergency motion work streams in the tables below. These proposals are likely 
to form a part of any future climate emergency strategies to be devised, once 
appro priate appraisals of viability in terms of financial and environmental impact 
have been carried out.
