economies and social infrastructures. The pandemic has also shown the powerful potential of our individual and collective behaviours 
to perpetuate, mitigate or even, to halt a crisis of almost unimaginable magnitude.
The 2030 Strategy sets out a context, rationale and approach for organising the work that will be needed to tackle our climate and 
ecological challenges. This Master Plan starts to organise work streams that will achieve the ambition by identifying a framework for 
delivery.

“If we don’t take climate action, the collapse of our 
civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural 
world is on the horizon.”Stroud District Council are pledged to do everything 
within the council’s power to make Stroud District carbon 
neutral by 2030.

PAGE 4   l    STROUD DISTRICT COUNCIL   l    THE 2030 STRATEGY MASTER PLANThis document details an approach to help limit the global effects of 
climate change by becoming a carbon neutral district by 2030. 
Many of the greenhouse gas emissions within the district are not 
within the direct control of Stroud District Council. There are lots of 
things that we can do as a local authority to improve our own services 
and operations, but a whole-hearted effort is required by everyone 
that lives or works here in parallel with, significant local, national and 
international government action to achieve our 2030 aims. 
A collaboration
Assembling this draft Strategy and Master Plan has involved:
4	collaboration with community groups and stakeholders, both within 
and outside the District Council. This has included participation 
in the Climate Action Network Forum, Local Strategic Partnership 
and in the Gloucestershire Energy Sector Group to name a few. 
Support from Stroud District Youth Council has also been greatly 
appreciated and we thank them for their contribution and ongoing 
collaboration for our 2030 mission.
4	drawing upon the evidence contained in commissioned reports 
and studies, aligned to the District Council’s Environmental 
Strategy and Local Plan Review.4	district and county-wide survey results and the work of 
professional and academic networks.
4	lessons learned from partnership delivery of recent projects and 
long-running services, including the sustainable energy focused 
domestic and business support programmes.
4	a series of on-line consultation events, chaired by local experts 
and attended by town and parish councils; youth groups; 
charitable, community and voluntary sector groups; businesses; 
private landowners and their associations; schools, colleges and, 
interested individuals.
This has driven the development of a strategy that strives to be:
	comprehensive in defining the wide range of necessary actions 
and development areas for the district
	targeted on required key achievements
	supportive in securing provision for the resources required
	agile, to enable community led schemes to come forward
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP...THEMES INTRODUCTION NEXT STEPS
PAGE 5   l    STROUD DISTRICT COUNCIL   l    THE 2030 STRATEGY MASTER PLANYou told us…
Vision and direction: The ambitious vision and direction was 
welcomed by almost everyone who took part and the challenge of 
achieving this was widely recognised. More explicit emphasis was 
wanted for the theme of leadership so we have named this in the 
strategy redraft and it remains covered by our role as exemplar and 
strategic partner through the commitments.
Leadership and responsibility: The approach of considering 
council influence and scope under the categories of Exemplar, Enabler 
and Encourager was considered clear. The balance of commitments 
across those spheres was also supported. It was noted that a clear 
steer on the purpose of the strategy and plan was needed. We have 
also taken on board the need for our mission statement to have a clear 
line on leadership and ecological emergency.
The proposal for community governance was welcomed and seen 
as very important. There were many good suggestions for how this 
should be rolled out and these ideas will feed its development as part 
of our very next steps after strategy adoption.Solutions and innovation:  We have now included the context 
of other district and county strategy and policy documents as a 
signpost to some of the aspects you noted as missing but that are 
available elsewhere. We will also be using community governance and 
continuing our collaborations with key stakeholders and experts to get 
the specifics right as we deliver actions.
Fact checking:  There was some helpful feedback on targets which 
have influenced the approaches in this re-draft.
Some wanted to know the detail on assumptions but others were 
impressed by the evidence paper.
The setting of targets over a 10-year stretch is a difficult matter and so, 
in this version, we have given this context and explained how we will 
keep targets under check for their sense and reliability in framing our 
aims and objectives for action.
A STRATEGY CONSULTATIONTHEMES INTRODUCTION NEXT STEPS
PAGE 6   l    STROUD DISTRICT COUNCIL   l    THE 2030 STRATEGY MASTER PLANOur draft 2030 Strategy defines a vision for 2030 across  
7 organising themes and establishes an approach towards 
tackling the climate, ecological and recovery emergencies 
facing us now and in the future.  
Where did we start?
The climate and ecological emergency can seem hugely complex 
and daunting, spanning issues from global peace and security to 
corporate responsibility, right down to the food in our cupboards and 
the insulation in our walls. 
We have tried to embrace a broad spectrum of concepts, issues and 
priorities, while streamlining them to focus on Stroud District’s specific 
context. We want to set out a strategy and plan that is comprehensive 
but also user-friendly. 
This draft Master Plan acts as a framework for the creation of policies, 
projects and schemes in an agile way across the topics as a whole. 
The purpose is to offer and invite flexible, multi-benefit solutions across 
the spectrum of issues. Each theme in the plan is framed by Stretch 
Goals for to keep action in focus.Our Mission is to always…
…act as an example in the community. To 
be an enabler and encourager of positive 
action. Through our services, policies and 
projects to demonstrate leadership doing 
everything in our power to collaboratively  
achieve a just transition to achieve 
ecosystem restoration and a carbon 
neutral, resilient, inclusive and, equality 
driven district.
WHERE DO WE WANT TO BE IN THE FUTURE?THEMES INTRODUCTION NEXT STEPS
PAGE 7   l    STROUD DISTRICT COUNCIL   l    THE 2030 STRATEGY MASTER PLANThere are 3 levels of action in the 
Master Plan, which relate to the 
council’s spheres of influence as 
“Exemplar”, “Enabler” and “Encourager”. 
Each commitment is loosely time framed 
over the decade, which is segmented 
into 3 phases that can be broadly 
considered as: 
(i) (2020 – 2023) preparation and 
pilots; 
(ii) (2023 - 2027) bigger projects and 
roll out schemes; 
(iii) (2027 – 2030) finalisation of 
schemes and next stage planning;
In practice things are not so neatly 
‘linear’ since we already have some 
well-developed projects. The council 
has a long track record of action, and 
the momentum on climate and ecology 
issues is well established. So some 
projects are underway and results are 
already being realised. These, projects 
in progress, are living examples of how 
the Master Plan can be a framework, an 
anchor for the detailed action plans that 
underpin action.EXEMPLAR  
… in our own operations
The area where we have the 
most direct influence. Here we 
strive to set the standards and 
be the pathfinder through the 
challenges facing the district. 
ENABLER  
… partnerships, policy, decisions 
and services
We have shared responsibility and 
influence in our partnerships and 
own projects, and sometimes as a 
facilitator to the projects of others.  
ENCOURAGER  
… advice, information, incentives
We have least influence in the 
private sector, but we can provide 
information and incentives to 
encourage behaviours and 
strategies that make positive 
contributions towards our vision of a 
carbon neutral and climate resilient 
Stroud district.
HOW DOES THIS WORK? 
Contextual themes
Cross-cutting themes  
in the Master Plan
Food and What we choose to eat, how we source and produce food, develop our 
agriculture  supply chains and deal with food waste – this cuts across a broad range 
of actions, including land use, transportation, waste and resources, our 
economy particularly the farming sector and, community. 
Water Flooding, water consumption and water stewardship – this topic is touched 
upon by almost all the themes, but is particularly linked to our actions in built 
and natural environment, waste and our community.
Balancing Energy efficiency is largely dealt with in the built environment actions, but
Carbon this topic is also visible in potential action that can be taken in relation to 
transport/mobility and community. The potentials for carbon sequestration 
and offset are also spread across the seven action areas. 
Social justice There is a key thread, running throughout the strategy and master plan and 
in support of COVID recovery needs that is a focus on climate and ecology 
to simultaneously raise housing standards, alleviate poverty and hunger, 
support job creation and strengthen community cohesion, health and 
wellbeing, resilience and inclusivity.
Funding and It is crucial to the success of this strategy that the master plan includes a 
investment range of actions across each of the themes that can generate, distribute and 
leverage funds to support the large scale investment needed.
County, National  This strategy rightly has a clear and strong local emphasis, but the ambitions
and Global will not be achieved without considerable efforts and collaborations locally,
Policy nationally and globally.
Leadership &   The council’s sphere of influence as an exemplar and enabler is where our
Agency:  role in taking leadership on issues is most apparent. There is also a drive to 
support and encourage local leadership on issues and actions.

…put our ‘own house’ in order
Joining up all parts of the council under a common mission, investing 
in our own property and changing our policies and practices in line 
with the ambition to achieve a carbon neutral and ecologically sound 
district is one way we will demonstrate leadership on our 2030 
ambitions..
… be the pathfinder
To help others in the district tackle their challenges we will exploit the 
opportunities of our land and buildings to demonstrate how things can 
be achieved and how new technologies can be applied.  
2Be an Enabler and...  
…play our part as a partner 
We will act as a focal point for diverse groups to come together. In 
partnerships and through consultation we will identify shared benefits 
and the initiatives to achieve them.
Our natural system is inextricably linked to the systems of other 
landowners and authorities; we are focused on making the most of our 
strategic relationships to maximise the potential.
…identify and support access to financial tools 
Funding and finance is a cross cutting theme of the plan with the intent 
that all potential ideas can be considered for viability.3Be Encouraging and…  
…actively promote good practice
The council will be looking for chances to incentivise through awards, 
accreditation and experience sharing as these help us all understand 
what ‘good’ looks like. 
We will be active in our communications and use a variety of ways to 
engage, advise and inform the district to help everyone get involved.
…signpost to credible expertise
There is an overwhelming wealth of information and support 
organisations that can help. There is a role for the council to offer good 
basic advice and reliable signposting and to facilitate community led 
action.
Finally,
The strategy outlines how we seek to build in community governance 
to the ongoing monitoring and reporting to the plan through 
establishing a ‘Core Group’ to represent community voice.

Key Priority – the retrofit challenge
In line with a national picture, the retrofit challenge for the district is to generate both demand

UK engineering consultancy, Burro Happold estimate that capacity must increase 10 fold to meet 
national 2050 targets and that increases the scale of challenge for our 2030 commitment.
Meeting this challenge will require cross sector working on economy, skills and, crucially, 
community engagement to drive the demand for sector growth.BUILT ENVIRONMENT THEMES INTRODUCTION NEXT STEPS

Public awareness of the variety, impacts and benefits of renewable energy options needs to 
be addressed in order to encourage wider adoption of these systems.
Marketing strategists have been tapping into the long term benefits of ‘early adopters’ or 
‘lighthouse customers’ for accelerating the success of innovations.
We need to work on making renewables accessible but also, as a first step, making them 
more desired. Education, communication, arts and community events can all play their part to

Key Priority – detail the local economic vision
Economic growth is required to meet both our recovery and the needs of future generations, it 
is therefore important we are clear on what a low carbon and circular economy means for the 
district and how we are going to work to achieve this.
Distinct economic strategy needs to be developed with 2030 Strategy central to its rationale.ECONOMYTHEMES INTRODUCTION NEXT STEPS
PAGE 30   l    STROUD DISTRICT COUNCIL   l    THE 2030 STRATEGY MASTER PLANWaste from the manufacture, & use 
of goods is minimised. Products last 
longer, breakdown into re-useable 
parts and there is a strong re-use/re-
manufacture economy that is reducing 
the need for landfill and recycling. 
People are well educated about 
avoiding waste and make good choices 
driving a low carbon, localised market.

the council no longer needs 
before classifying as waste.We will ensure our contractors 
and public service providers 
are also minimising waste 
through their practices including 
those delivering demolition 
and construction projects with 
reclamation opportunities.We are maintaining direct links 
to organisations that re-use and 
remanufacture equipment and as 
a result the council has minimised 
waste being producedWith more considered thought 
to how we dispose of equipment 
we could be supporting those 
who rely on re-purposed 
goods. E.g.  the repurposing of 
computer equipment through 
third sector organisations in

Shape service delivery to be 
waste free (e.g. paperless

procedures in place at our 
main office site to our other 
public service sites alongside 
programmes of staff development 
to ensure all staff are aware of 
their impacts in this area and that 
responsibilities have been defined 
for key individuals.The council will have clear and 
accurate data on the components of 
waste across its estate and will be 
keeping this under review in order 
to achieve optimum reductions.In order to effectively implement

procurement and culture change 
around waste we need to be 
informed and in control of our

W4 Recycle The council will identify the 
potential in its existing waste 
depots for enhanced storage 
and sorting facilities to facilitate 
identifying and processing 
waste for re-use/recycling / 
composting.As local re-use/remanufacture 
concepts are developed the 
council will work with communities 
to identify how its waste sorting 
and storing can link to local 
schemes and initiatives for 
material supply and other services.The council has  some leading 
waste processing facilities and 
will be considering how to further 
enhance its sites and services.Improving waste infrastructure

composition and quantity is 
monitored and managed at the 
council offices and other sites. There will be no single use plastics 
on our estates and a reduction 
in the use of plastic generally 
as procurement practices are 
refined by policy that encourages 
consideration of whole life cost of

SortingBuilding on our success in 
reducing landfill waste across 
the District we will set ourselves 
a progressive series of annual 
targets to reduce the overall 
amount of waste collected at 
kerbside District. The council will support recycling 
schemes through Local Plan 
infrastructure policy. It will 
focus on reducing waste and 
increasing public and community 
opportunities to reuse and/or 
recycle their waste. District waste is at a minimum 
and the council work to maintain 
a standing in the top councils 
nationally and to promote our 
Districts achievements. We will 
continue to look for ways to improve 
facilities for waste disposal with an 
emphasis on re-use/remanufacture. 
 This is in keeping with ‘use less’ 
principle - recycling is positive 
but still very energy intensive. 
Reducing waste at source is an 
important tactic. Making it easy 
for people to dispose of their 
waste in a manner that enables 
it to be useful for remanufacture 
or recycling purposes no matter 
where the ‘waste’ is created.Waste tonnage

use of the county’s food waste 
to provide bio methane into 
the gas grid by exploring 
opportunities in agricultural 
waste and, also to ensure that 
other types of commercial/
industrial and agricultural waste 
such as heat are maximised for 
our energy needs.We will facilitate partnerships and 
support funding bids to ensure 
that any suitable infrastructure 
projects identified in phase 1 are 
carried forward.There are a number of reference  
projects for thinking differently 
about waste in the District and the 
Council are identifying ways to 
encourage more innovations.There is a lot of potential in 
waste for our energy needs 
and some of the processes 
used have bi-products that also 
have wider uses. For example, 
Anaerobic digesters, produce 
a safe fertiliser which can be 
used for crops. This brings 
opportunities to develop the 
food growing potential within 
the county to shorten food 
supply chains and build food 
security.Waste related

recycling so that funds can be 
created to support low waste 
projects.Ongoing There is a new perspective on 
waste as a resource in the District 
and the Council is working to

Key Priority – District Dialogue
The 2030 Strategy has big implications for all of us. Putting community voice at the heart of 
its execution and governance is seen as vital in generating the ownership and buy-in that will 
deliver the 2030 mission and visions.COMMUNITYINTRODUCTION NEXT STEPS
PAGE 39   l    STROUD DISTRICT COUNCIL   l    THE 2030 STRATEGY MASTER PLANTHEMESThe progress through the master plan will not be linear, starting 
at the beginning on launch day and completing in 2030. The 
council’s long awareness of the urgency of this situation means 
that there is significant headway in many areas as outlined in the 
starting points described for each theme in the strategy document.
Consolidating these existing achievements into a system that ensures 
as a council and community are sharing achievements, lessons 
learned, evidence base and challenges must be the very next job. 
This will help us to be informed and collaborative in ongoing decision 
making. Working collaboratively council and community can better define the 
principles that will underpin the path to net zero, working from the 
outputs of national research such as, Climate Assembly UK and the 
inputs of the District Dialogue that will be established.
Following steps need to focus on the master plans key priority areas 
to develop and upscale projects and services that accelerate the 
progress to our carbon neutral ambitions.The first next step:
